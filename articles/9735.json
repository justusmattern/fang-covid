In Paris, a mother is worried about her daughter: Since spring, she has been afraid of strangers.\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch.\nHow are our European neighbors doing in the pandemic? What is life like\nthese days in France, Ireland, Bulgaria and elsewhere? In the series \"We\nNeighbors\", Europeans will be talking about their everyday lives: the taxi\ndriver in Dublin, the mother in Paris working from home, the theater family in\nBulgaria. They are also all taking part in Europe Talks, a discussion event for\nwhich ZEIT ONLINE, together with media partners from 15 countries, is\nregistering participants. On Dec. 13, thousands of people from across Europe\nwill meet another European to discuss and debate the corona crisis.\n\"I\nhave noticed that the lockdown has changed people. On one hand, for the better.\nThey have more time to reflect: What are the really fulfilling aspects of my\nlife? How much importance should I attach to my job? People have more time to\nread, to exercise, things that often fall by the wayside in our hectic,\nday-to-day lives.\nBut\nthey have also changed for the worse. During the first lockdown in spring, my\nhusband and I worked from home, and we also had our daughter at home with us.\nShe was just one-and-a-half years old and the daycare centers were closed. She\nis at an age in which she needs a huge amount of attention to develop. She is\ntoo young to understand that you sometimes just have to shut the door when\nyou're working. It's not exactly easy for us.\nMy\ngirl is a very sociable child. During the first lockdown, she barely saw other\nchildren at all. When were allowed to go out again afterward and the daycare\ncenters reopened, she was a little bit afraid when she saw other children. She\nno longer actively approaches strangers like she used to. Plus, there are\nparents who are telling their children to avoid people they don't know to the\nextent possible. It does something to children \u2013 to people in general \u2013 when\nthey approach others and are seen as a potential danger. When they feel the\nrejection.\nIt\nconcerns me. What kind of life is it for our children when they only see people\nin masks? They aren't learning how to read emotions on people's faces, at least\nthat's what the experts are saying. It's especially important in the first\nyears of life. I have heard of children who pull their parent's mask back up\nover their nose if it slides down. They have apparently started accepting\nmasked faces as being completely normal.\nI\nhad just started a new job with a software provider when the pandemic started\nin March. I was never able to get to know my colleagues in person. I only met a\nfew of them during my job interview. I miss the human contact aspect of work \u2013\nof exchanges that go beyond the purely functional.\nI\nused to work as a management consultant in Paris, and I learned a lot about how\ncompanies change when they shift toward digitalization. During the pandemic,\nmore happened on this front in just a brief amount of time than in all the\nyears that came before! There is a meme that is being passed around the French\ninternet at the moment: \"Who pushed through digitalization in your\ncompany? The CEO? Or COVID-19?\" It's actually pretty accurate. Prior to\nthe pandemic, a lot of companies were opposed to allowing their employees work\nfrom home. Now, though, they have been forced to change just to survive.\nSince\nthe beginning of the pandemic, there has been a lot of criticism of the\ngovernment in France \u2013 the approach to masks, for example, especially during\nthe first lockdown. First, we were told: Don't wear them. Then, we were allowed\nto wear them if we wanted. Later, we were told not to buy them because there\nwouldn't be enough for medical workers. And now, we are required to wear them.\nAll of us. Inside, of course, but there are now also streets in Paris where you\nhave to wear them outside as well. But in other streets, you don't. That makes\nno sense. Still, I understand that the government can only make decisions based\non the current state of knowledge.\nThe\nfirst lockdown in spring was really difficult for us. There was a time when you\ncould only leave your home with a permission form. It was extremely strict, but\nunderstandable. Some things, though, were simply incomprehensible. At some\npoint, you were no longer allowed to take a walk in the forest. You could go to\nthe beach, but you couldn't go surfing. Those things have since been rectified,\nbut many people are still confused. What are we allowed to do? What really\nhelps? What measures are just contrived?\nFrance was hit especially hard by the second wave of the pandemic. In the fall, case numbers rose steeply, with up to 60,000 new infections registered each day. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 50,000 people have died in the country, which has a population of 67 million.\nThe French government reacted to the second wave with drastic measures, many of which are still in place today. People in France are only allowed to leave their homes if they have a good reason to do so, such as going to work or to do the shopping. You are only allowed to go on walks or exercise for three hours a day and within a 20-kilometer radius of your home. Until recently, you could only exercise for one hour within a one-kilometer radius. Some shops have now been allowed to reopen, but they have to follow strict hygiene guidelines.\nThe strict lockdown resulted in a sharp reduction in the number of cases. Recently, there have only been around 15,000 new infections each day. It is expected that measures will be further relaxed in December.\n \nIn\nthe middle of October, when the case numbers were still lower, we flew to\nCasablanca on vacation to visit my family. I was born in Morocco. We were\nlooking forward to a nice family vacation. But then, the second lockdown was\nannounced in France shortly after we arrived in Morocco. It took us completely\noff guard. Our return tickets were cancelled, so we have extended our stay in\nMorocco until Christmas. The numbers have been climbing in Casablanca since\nsummer. There is an 8 p.m. curfew and your temperature is taken before you are\nallowed to go into shops. We just have to wait until the vaccine arrives.\nA\nlot of people in France are worried about civil rights and autocratic\ntendencies during the pandemic. Recently, for example, when the government\npassed a law forbidding the sharing of photos and videos of police officers\nduring an operation. It was allegedly to protect their safety. But people are\nwondering: What kinds of things are taking place that I'm not supposed to know\nabout?\nFrance\nis a centralized state. Paris is everything and everything is in Paris. It's\nwhere decisions for the entire country are made. People don't like it. There\nare some mayors who are trying to resist and are reopening bars in their cities\non their own, for example.\nAnd\nthen there is Dr. Didier Raoult, a doctor and microbiologist from Marseille in\nthe South of France. Marseille and Paris: The two cities have a long rivalry \u2013\nin football, in history and in culture. That could be one reason why Dr. Raoult\nis so popular. He isn't just another expert from Paris who spouts the\ngovernment line. Raoult has a quite a striking beard and \"tells it like it\nis.\" Early on in the pandemic, he was appointed to the government's team\nof scientific advisers. But he resigned a short time later. He then began\nclaiming that he could heal COVID-19. Still, many people listen to what Raoult says.\nSince\nthe beginning of the pandemic, the thing I have missed most is travel. I was\nalways on the road a lot and I have friends around the world. I miss them. My\nfamily and I have come up with a new tradition. Every two weeks, we pick a\ncountry to travel to inside our apartment. Mexico, for example. We cook Mexican\nfood, listen to Mexican music and call friends in Mexico via video chat.\nVirtual traveling, if you will. It's not quite as nice as real travel, but it's\nthe best we can do at the moment.\"\nTranslated by Charles Hawley and Daryl Lindsey", "twitter-history": "[{       \"id\": 1335183401087885312,       \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/mycountrytalks/status/1335183401087885312\",       \"date\": \"2020-12-05 11:25:03+00:00\",       \"text\": \"In the new series We Neighbors @zeitonline talks to Europeans about their everyday lives: Salma Ait Hassoun, 31, a management consultant in Paris, is worried about the social development of her little daughter during the pandemic.
