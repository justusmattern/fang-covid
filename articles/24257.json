     "article": "A new hospital, how to help others and enjoy music safely at home: Tagesspiegel's Checkpoint newsletter updates you on the Coronavirus in Berlin. Tagesspiegel's newsletter Checkpoint runs from Monday till Saturday and brings you the latest news at 6am (learn more about the German edition here). Due to the current Corona Crisis, a translation for Berlin's English speaking community will be provided regularly. Translation: Kathleen W\u00e4chter, Lily Coates, Jakob Schlandt\nWhat are you grateful for? Are you usually aware what it is you\u2019re hoping? Would you like the absolute memory? And: Do you consider yourself a good friend?\nA majority of shops will be closed as of today, Wednesday, with exceptions for supermarkets and pharmacies, banks, hairdressers, newspaper and bookshops, hardware stores, tradesmen, technicians and funeral homes.\n\u201cI think you can explain to children\u201d, said Kalayci. But you can\u2019t explain to a virus. And those who were outside on Tuesday could observe: the playgrounds were packed. Except in Mitte, where they are closed. On Wednesday, several other districts followed its example: Reinickendorf, Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Steglitz-Zehlendorf and Spandau also closed their playgrounds, while Pankow, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and Lichtenberg intend to keep them open.\nIt is only a matter of time before the virus hits the refugee camp in Moria. \u201cThere is a threat that these people will be infected, that they will have no humanitarian care and will be left to alone their fate. If the epidemic breaks out in such a camp, it will be almost impossible to break the chain of infection\u201d, write the petition\u2019s initiators at #LeaveNoOneBehind (German).\nThe Union is therefore calling upon all members who are not active in the inpatient sector or indispensably bound, to contact the head physicians of nearby hospitals. \u201cGetting in contact early and making arrangements in advance of a further spread of the crisis is key.\u201d We\u2019re thanking you in advance.\nYoung People, 20 to 29 Years of Age \u2013 Stay At Home! \nShow Some Solidarity\nThe idea: regulars can buy vouchers and help their favourite places to remain solvent. Those vouchers can be redeemed later. Affected businesses are invited to register via bitte@helfen.berlin or on the website. A real community thrives in  good times, and reveals its true value in bad times.\nCouple therapist Hergen von Huchting has a tip for those who are forced to stay at home together: \u201cThe best thing is to arrange for actual retreat spaces early on. So if things are heating up or escalating, one can simply remove oneself to another room, or in an emergency even lock the kitchen door\u201d, he says.\nStay Informed! \nIf you have slight cold symptoms, it is best to contact a local general practitioner by telephone - recently it has also become possible to take sick leave for up to seven days, the regulation is valid until 5 April. The sick note is then sent by post.\nIn the case of an upper respiratory tract illness, the doctor can certify that the parents are unable to work. Prerequisite: In the last 14 days there must have been demonstrable contact with persons who have fallen ill with the coronavirus or have been in a risk area.\nThe Senate recommends in principle to be particularly vigilant in the following cases: Anyone who has had contact with a confirmed corona patient in the past two weeks should stay at home and contact the responsible health authority. This also applies if you have been in one of the risk areas defined by the the German epidemic authority RKI in the past weeks (here is an overview) \u2013 especially if you have (even slight) symptoms. Comprehensive information from the Senate Health Administration can be found here.\nBarmer, one of the biggest, for example can be reached by calling 0800/8484111 (again, don\u2019t forget to first dial the German country code 0049 and leave out the first 0 in case you call from abroad). DAK, another big insurer, has provided the number 040/325325800 (call at local rate) around the clock. There, doctors and hygiene experts can answer the questions of worried callers. Those insured with other health insurance companies may also contact the two health insurance companies.\nThe fire department and the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KV) Berlin started a joint transport service on Wednesday. Between 7 and 22 o'clock this service will take care of patients with severe colds who need a doctor at home or in nursing homes. This service can be reached at 116117 from all German areas.These are the six contact points at hospitals in Berlin.\nAnyone wishing to visit the outpatient clinic at the Havelh\u00f6he Hospital is requested to first call the clinic's hotline on Tel. 030/36501-7222. A little patience may be necessary. The hotline is practically \"permanently manned\", a spokeswoman said on Monday.",
