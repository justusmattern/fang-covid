Otherwise We Won't Be Able To Handle It\"", "article": "Virologist Christian Drosten is guiding Germany through the current pandemic. He spoke to ZEIT ONLINE about the length of the crisis \u2013 and how it will change our lives.\nLesen Sie dieses Interview auf Deutsch.\nWhat seemed impossible just one week ago is\nnow reality: The coronavirus pandemic is fundamentally changing life in\nGermany. For the first time in the country's postwar history, a worldwide travel\nadvisory is in effect. The government has asked people to stay at home. Movie\ntheaters, bars and shops are shuttered. Daycare centers and schools are closed.\nIt marks the beginning of what is sure to be a difficult time. And nobody knows\nexactly how long it will last. In this time of uncertainty, we need facts \u2013 and\nserious scientists to explain them to us. Virologist Christian Drosten has\nbecome Germany's de facto explainer for the current outbreak, with tens of\nthousands of people listening to his podcast from German public broadcaster NDR\nevery day. ZEIT ONLINE met Drosten at his office in the Institute of Virology\nat Berlin's Charit\u00e9 university hospital.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Life as we know it is changing at the\nmoment. Mr. Drosten, are you worried?\nChristian Drosten: Like many other people, I, too, am in denial about the current\nsituation to a certain extent. I hope for my family and for myself that it\nwon't affect us. But it very well could. And then there are others who are\nignoring our new reality completely.\nZEIT\nONLINE: People in this country, though, are listening\nto you and what you say carries great weight. What effect is this role having\non you?\nDrosten: I just sort of slipped into it. It's also becoming a bit\noverwhelming, all the media inquiries, advising politicians. I'm not a\npolitician, I'm a scientist. I'm happy to explain what I know. Scientific\nfindings must be communicated to everyone transparently, so that we all can get\nan idea of the situation. But I'm also honest about what I don't know. I always\nhave been.\nZEIT\nONLINE: The country is grinding to a halt. Daycare\ncenters and schools have been closed nationwide as of this week. Is the\ngovernment reacting appropriately at the moment?\nDrosten: Few of the decisions made in recent days were purely\nevidence-based. Many were political, and certainly correct. Some were surely\ninfluenced by the strict measures in neighboring countries. But either way: I\nhave the impression that a switch has now been flipped in all states across\nGermany. Now a decision has been made to ban public events and close daycares\nand schools.\nZEIT\nONLINE: It is said that you played a central\nconsultative role in the decision to close schools. Was it the correct decision\nto do so now?\nDrosten: I don't know. It probably won't be clear until later whether it was\nthe right time to do this. I've always maintained that scientists from other\ndisciplines must also be heard, and that kind of decision is outside the realm\nof competence of an epidemiologically trained virologist like myself. I don't\nsee my job as condensing the truth, but as explaining aspects of the truth and\nallowing for uncertainties and saying, 'We don't know' \u2013 which makes a political\ndecision necessary. And as long as it's communicated as a political decision, I\nthink that's fine.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Will the measures work?\nDrosten: Hopefully, they will decisively change the dynamics of the\ndisease's transmission. It's possible that we'll be able to judge this by\nEaster. Maybe we'll see that fewer people have been infected than we would have\nexpected amid the current exponential growth. That the curve has grown flatter.\nInitially, however, this will have less of an impact on the death rate, because\nsome of those who will die before Easter are already infected now or will be in\nthe coming days. What's more, the recent decisions won't have an immediate\neffect. It will take a few days. Some things have become normalized. Many people have figured out childcare solutions, for example. And more and more people are understanding that they shouldn't\nmeet up in groups anymore. It will take some time for people to get used to\nthis.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Stricter measures, such as forbidding\npeople from leaving their homes for non-essential reasons, are under\nconsideration \u2013 largely because apparently not everyone has understood that\nthey should stay home and reduce their contact with others in order to protect\nthe community at large.\nDrosten: I think that in the next few days, the penny will finally drop.\nThese measures are still quite new, but most people will have grasped it. There\nwill always be some people who are incorrigible. Of course, people like that\ndon't exist in China \u2013 there, they are censured. But I'm glad that we don't\nlive in that kind of society. And I'm not sure whether it's even necessary, in\nterms of the overall epidemic, to find every last person who's not following\nthe rules.\nZEIT\nONLINE: So, given the corona parties that have been\ntaking place, you wouldn't say: \"From now on, no one is allowed to go outside?\"\nDrosten: Who am I to say such a thing? I can say that as a virologist, in my\nfield, up to a certain point, this is the way things are. Other things just\ndon't fall into my area of competence. Then I'm no longer a scientist, but a\nprivate citizen. I don't have a mandate from voters. But I do believe that by\nshutting down bars and restaurants, cancelling major events and closing\ndaycares and schools, a great deal has already been achieved. The goal is to\nprevent as many people as possible from coming into contact with one another.\nZEIT\nONLINE: What's your assessment of how Germany\nmanaged the earliest stages of this outbreak?\nDrosten: I believe that Germany recognized its own outbreak very early on.\nWe're two or three weeks ahead of some of our neighbors. We've been able to do\nthis because we've been doing so many diagnostics, so much testing. Of course,\nwe missed some cases in this early stage, that always happens. But I don't\nthink we overlooked a major outbreak. This assertion is also supported by the\nfact that we are seeing cases in Germany increase as expected. But we're also\nseeing that we have fewer deaths than other countries. One could deduce,\ntherefore, that we're not that far off from the total number of cases we have.\nWe certainly aren't identifying all of the cases, but relatively, we are seeing\nmore than other countries that are testing less.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Like Italy, for instance?\n\nDrosten: In Italy, tests are apparently primarily performed on people who\nget admitted to the hospital. That's because people there know that there\naren't enough tests to go around anyway, so they initially stay home, even if\nthey have symptoms. They only go to the hospital if their condition worsens.\nThere, they arrive with shortness of breath and are immediately admitted to the\nintensive care unit, where they are then tested for the first time. This is why\nthe average age of recorded cases is much higher in Italy than here in Germany.\nI assume that many young Italians are or were infected without ever being\ndetected. This also explains the virus' supposedly higher mortality rate there.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: How much longer will we be able to keep up\nwith testing in Germany?\nDrosten: At some point, this won't be possible anymore. We're simply not\nable to increase our testing capacity as quickly as the number of cases rises.\nThen two things will coincide: First, some of the people who are now sick with\nCOVID-19 will die. And second, because we won't be able to test everyone, our\nstatistics will be incomplete. Our fatality rate will then also rise. It will\nappear that the virus has become more dangerous, but this will be a statistical\nartifact, a distortion. It will simply reflect what's already starting to\nhappen: We're missing more and more infections.\nZEIT\nONLINE: What can we do about it?\nDrosten: We have to take shortcuts. If one person in a household tests\npositive, we could, for instance, consider the entire household to be positive,\neven without a test. Because we know that is what is going to happen: If one\nfamily member gets infected, they infect everyone else. If you say right away\nthat the entire family is positive, you save yourself a lot of testing. Imagine\nthat you're infected, and the next day your wife has to go and stand in line.\nAnd then imagine the test doesn't detect her infection yet, and she has to come\nback. That doesn't make any sense. So, it's better if the entire family isolates\nat home from the get-go. They're already doing this in the Netherlands and I'm\ngoing to suggest that Germany follow suit in discussions with health\nauthorities.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: What other options are there?\nDrosten: At some point, suspected cases will be reported only on the basis\nof symptoms and then the statistics will begin to reflect this. At the same\ntime, available tests will have to be reserved for those people most at risk.\nIf an otherwise healthy student is at home on her couch watching Netflix, as a\ngeneral practitioner, I don't need to know whether she's positive or not. She\nshould just stay there and get better. But when a 70-year-old patient of mine\ngets sick and is isolated at home, then I'd like to test him in order to then\nbe able to call every two days and ask how his breathing is. That way, he can\nbe admitted to a hospital early enough and doesn't show up to an out-patient\nclinic with a clotted lung and have to immediately be transferred to an intensive\ncare unit.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Will we soon have tests that are faster\nthan the current ones?\nDrosten: Some are already commercially available, mostly those that detect\nantibodies. Their quality probably varies. And they only work after 10 days,\nsince that's when patients have developed antibodies. In the first 10 days,\nthese tests are blind, so to speak. We have to wait until antigen tests are\ndeveloped, which can actually detect viral proteins. These tests will work like\na pregnancy test \u2013 and they'll also provide results just as quickly. If the\ntests work well, they'll be able to completely replace the current ones. Then\npeople won't have to wait in lines anymore. I hope this will happen by May.\nZEIT\nONLINE: By then, millions of people could be\ninfected. How well are German clinics prepared for that eventuality?\nDrosten: No matter how you count or who you speak to: We have to bring down\nthe number of cases now. Otherwise we won't be able to handle it. Otherwise\nwe'll have exactly the same problems as Italy within a few weeks. We do have\nmore beds, and maybe we're a little better trained. But even though intensive\ncare in Germany is good, there's still not enough of it. Based on the current\nfigures, we would need \u2013 even by conservative estimates \u2013 to double our current\nintensive-care capacity in order to even come close to ventilating everyone who\nneeds it.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: Germany's federal and state governments\nhave now adopted an emergency plan. Additional capacities for minor cases are\nto be created and the number of intensive care beds doubled.\nDrosten: That's a good plan. And in order to do this, we need the time that\nwe hope to buy with the current measures. Now is the phase in which ventilators\nare still being ordered and hospital wards cleared. All this (points to a\nnearby building) belongs to the hospital. Normally it's used for offices.\nNow it's being cleared out and beds are being set up inside \u2013 including ones\nwith ventilators. Processes like these take a few weeks. That's what the weeks\nwe're trying to buy ourselves now are for, and not primarily for developing a\nvaccine.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Let's look at the virus itself. You have\nbeen researching coronaviruses for many years. What has surprised you most\nabout SARS-CoV-2 so far?\nDrosten: Clearly the fact that it replicates in the throat. With the SARS\nvirus, which caused the outbreak in 2002-2003, we were never able to isolate it\nin the throat. SARS patients had far fewer viruses in their bodies and the\npathogens were far less infectious. In addition, the new coronavirus contains\nan astonishing biological innovation: a protease cleavage site in the surface\nprotein of the virus. In the case of\nbird flu, for example, whether this site is there or not makes the difference\nwhether the pathogen makes poultry very sick or not.\nZEIT\nONLINE: What's so special about this cleavage site?\nDrosten: The surface protein must be cut so that the virus can mature and\nenter the next cell. And this cleavage site may enable the virus to be cut even\nwhen it's only just been released from the last infected cell. It's like a\nsheet of paper that's easier to tear off the notepad because it's perforated.\nAnd SARS-CoV-2 has this perforation.\nZEIT\nONLINE: What does this mean for the disease?\nDrosten: We don't know for sure yet. It could allow the virus to already be\nmature when it leaves the cell \u2013 ready to enter the next one. This could also\nbe the reason why SARS-CoV-2 replicates so well in the throat and why it can be\ntransmitted so easily. We now have to figure all that out.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Just like the question as to the precise case\nfatality rate.\nDrosten: Right now, there's actually another variable that's more important:\nthe so-called infection fatality rate. This indicates the percentage of\ninfected people who die \u2013 including those who have no or only a few symptoms\nand are therefore not recorded as cases. As such, it also serves as an estimate\nof how high the number of unreported cases is. How many people who contract the\ndisease don't show any symptoms at all, or only have sore throats? Among the\nfirst infected people in Germany, whom we closely examined for a study, there\nwere quite a few. At the moment, I often hear that 80 percent of cases have\nonly mild symptoms. But my impression is: Maybe it's even a lot more. That\nwould be important to know. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Elderly and sick people are particularly at\nrisk of contracting COVID-19. Yet over and over again, there are also reports\nof people in their early or mid-30s who have to be admitted to intensive care\nor who even die. Why is that?\nDrosten: This is also the case with other respiratory diseases, that younger\npeople sometimes fall seriously ill. But we often don't know a lot about\npeople. In the media, you'll here: \"A 35-year-old is in intensive care.\"\nBut a 35-year-old can have massive underlying diseases. We know, for example,\nthat a high body mass index is a major risk factor for COVID-19, as is coronary\nheart disease, i.e. a narrowing of the coronary vessels due to vascular\ncalcification. Pneumonia puts a massive strain on the cardiovascular system. If\nthat system is already damaged, the extra strain can sometimes overwhelm it.\nAnd there are many people between the ages of 35 and 50 who live with such risk\nfactors. Another hypothesis is that someone may inhale a huge dose of the virus\ndirectly into their lungs. Then the virus immediately replicates deep within\nthe respiratory tract without having previously triggered any immune response\nin the throat. Then people might get really sick right away and the body has no\nremedy for it yet. Like I said, it's a hypothesis.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: According to what we know so far, men are\nmore likely to fall ill than women. Are there clues as to why that might be?\nDrosten: We don't know for sure yet. It's possible that risk factors like\nthe ones we just discussed are more common in men. Some studies also suggest\nthat the binding site the virus uses to enter cells is especially common on the\ncells of Asians, and especially males. But honestly, I think this explanation\nfits into the picture well and that's why it was interpreted this way. Besides,\nthe virus is also spreading outside China, so I don't think this argument is\nvery likely. There just isn't any good data on this yet.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: You've often said that neither drugs nor\nvaccines will be available in time for this outbreak. Is there no hope at all?\nDrosten: It is conceivable that the situation will become so bad that\nregulations will be suspended. One could imagine certain aspects of vaccine\napproval being ignored during this crisis and vaccines that haven't been tested\nwell being used on people. These are far-fetched scenarios, and they're\nspeculative. But if things get very bad \u2013 and I don't want to rule that out at\nthe moment \u2013 something like this could be conceivable. A number of biotech\ncompanies have had vaccine candidates in the pipeline for quite some time.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: In the U.S. this week, a volunteer test\nsubject received a possible vaccine manufactured by a private biotech company.\nIt is based on mRNA, so small pieces of genetic material. Is this the right\napproach?\nDrosten: I can't really say yet. I think it's a quick approach. I don't know\nif it's also the mass approach we need right now. At the moment, this would\nperhaps more likely be a surface protein of the virus that can be produced en\nmasse and against which the immune system produces antibodies in large\nquantities. Some companies are pursuing this approach. That kind of vaccine\nwould then be earmarked for risk groups. If things were to get really bad, one\ncould imagine something like this happening.\nZEIT\nONLINE: At what point would you say things are bad\nenough for such steps to be taken?\nDrosten: I can't and don't want to imagine that at the moment.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Do you consider any medications promising?\nDrosten: I see the antiviral drug remdesivir as the best option. It was\noriginally developed to treat Ebola. Studies are currently underway, but at the\nmoment, the manufacturer only permits it to be used on people who are already\nseriously ill, and only then under a special protocol and only within a small\ntimeframe. Ideally, it would be possible to give it to patients sooner, and for\nthat, much greater quantities would have to be available. We now have to wait\nand see what the first results are.\nZEIT\nONLINE: And other drugs?\nDrosten: I don't see any real alternatives. Neither the malaria drug\nchloroquine nor the HIV drugs ritonavir/lopinavir. Both have been the subject\nof clinical studies, but the results haven't been convincing.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Italy is apparently considering experimenting\nwith treating patients with the plasma of people who have already recovered\nfrom the infection.\n\nDrosten: It is a tempting idea. There still isn't any published data on the\ntreatment, but there are a lot of young, healthy patients who would be perfect\nplasma donors. When they become infected, they produce the best antibodies\naround. If they are administered to patients at the right moment, then it is\ncertainly a possibility. I can imagine that in maybe two months, the first small\nanalyses of case studies \u2013 potentially also from Germany \u2013 will be available. But\nextremely rapid results, at least on a large scale, cannot be expected from all\nof these measures.\nZEIT\nONLINE: What about from rising springtime\ntemperatures?\nDrosten: This effect isn't likely to be particularly pronounced. It won't be\nable to stop the outbreak, but it may help a bit. And combined with the\nisolation measures, I strongly expect that we will see an impact in a month.\nZEIT\nONLINE: And then? What happens after that?\nDrosten: We perhaps have to assume that from a societal\nperspective, we'll have to go through a year in a state of emergency. But we\nprobably won't continue pursuing all measures precisely as we have now\nintroduced them. We will be able to, we will have to, adjust them. Some things\nwill be phased out. But during the initial phase between now and the week after\nEaster, we really have to take rigorous action and keep a close eye on the\ndevelopment of the number of cases.\nZEIT\nONLINE: A year of a state of emergency? What will\nour lives look like during this period?\nDrosten: Nobody knows. I can't imagine it yet either. More than anything, a\nsolution for our schools must be found. That is the most important thing. At\nthe universities, I think it's OK to lose a semester or two. But losing an\nentire schoolyear is simply too difficult because there is so much depending on\nit, not least for our economy. We'll have to find a solution. And, of course,\nalso for those who are particularly at risk.\nZEIT\nONLINE: What kinds of things do you have in mind?\nDrosten: Certain arrangements could be made specifically for such risk\ngroups, for example by rigorously testing the elderly and those at risk early\non and giving them priority when it comes to hospital admissions. And those at\nhigher risk will have to continue to work from home, for an extended period. It\ncould be possible to find ways to isolate elderly people at home. There could\nbe shuttle services for them, and groceries would have to be delivered to them.\nVolunteers could help, perhaps even the German military. And in day-to-day\nlife, children would have to be kept away from those at risk as strictly as\npossible.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: And then the schools could be opened again?\nDrosten: Perhaps measures could be imposed, like half the school can use\nonly these hallways and the other half the other hallways. There would no\nlonger be a long recess, and perhaps no short ones either. Common rooms would\nno longer be used and would be locked. With such measures, you can reduce\neffective group sizes in the schools. That would require some planning, but we\nhave time between now and the week after Easter. The most important thing is\nthat we need scientific data regarding the situation at schools.\nZEIT\nONLINE: And what if grandparents want to see their\ngrandchildren again?\nDrosten: Perhaps it will be the case that grandchildren will first have to\nundergo a test when they want to visit grandma and grandpa to be sure that they\ndon't infect them. Such details now need to be clarified. With the political\ndecisions that have been made, social life has been put on hold. But hopefully\nadjustments can be made with the help of scientific findings and modelling that\napply specifically to Germany.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: When will people be able to go back to work?\nDrosten: In the medical world, consideration is already being given to the idea of testing people\nso they can go to work. Once antigen tests are available, that could be\nexpanded to include other occupational groups. Plus, if we assume that during\nthe current wave of infections, perhaps 10 to 15 million people will become\ninfected in Germany by autumn, we will soon have a large number of people with\nantibodies. People who are immune. Then, there will be doctors and nurses who\ncan work without masks, and in other occupational groups, there will also be\npeople who say: \"I've made it through.\" And their number will\ncontinually increase.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: For how long will those people be immune?\nDrosten: Those who have become infected will likely be\nimmune for the rest of the pandemic, I would think \u2013 for a couple of years. And\neven if you were to become infected again, then it would be experienced as a\nharmless cold. The second infection wouldn't be as bad. That, at least, would\nbe my best guess at present.\n\nZEIT\nONLINE: How can we find out who has already been\ninfected?\nDrosten: By performing large, cross-sectional studies in the population, once\nin summer and again in October. Ideally it could be done with the help of blood\nbanks, where blood is already being taken and stored. The goal must be that of establishing\na decent estimate for each age group as to how many people have made it through\nthe infection and now have antibodies. By doing so, it will be possible to find\nout whether we have reached the 60 to 70 percent level, which is the share of\nthe population that will likely ultimately be infected.\nZEIT\nONLINE: And then the virus will be gone after a\nyear and a half?\nDrosten: No, it will likely follow the path of the other coronaviruses that\nmerely give you a cold. We will have to live with them, but they aren't as\ndangerous to us anymore once with have withstood the current outbreak.\nZEIT\nONLINE: That all sounds like an immense challenge.\nAre we up to it as a society?\nDrosten: It will be a difficult time and there will be huge economic losses.\nBut yes, of course we'll get through it. We have to.\nTranslators: Chris Cottrell and Charles\nHawley\n\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044c\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0414\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440.", "twitter-history": "[{       \"id\": 1352602883510972423,       \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/goddeketal/status/1352602883510972423\",       \"date\": \"2021-01-22 13:03:52+00:00\",       \"text\": \"15/ There is one last comment, I would like to make about scientific integrity.
