And Europe will be weakened – in part because of Germany's resistance to coronabonds.\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nHow the coronavirus is relentlessly exposing design flaws in\nthe common currency union and why the pandemic is a crisis of modernity: An\ninterview with Adam Tooze, an economic historian at Columbia University in New\nYork and author of the bestseller \"Crashed: How a Decade of Financial\nCrises Changed the World.\"\nZEIT\nONLINE: Mr. Tooze, as a historian, you study the great crises of\nhumankind. What is happening right now?\nAdamTooze:\nThis crisis will change the world. In 1992, James Carville, Bill Clinton’s\nchief adviser, coined the phrase: It’s the economy, stupid. It sounded\nperfectly wise and reasonable. But we know today that it isn’t true. We are prepared\nto paralyze entire economies to protect the risk groups, the elderly and people\nwith pre-existing conditions. The specific aim is to prevent overloading the\nhealth-care system by any means necessary. You might say that we are dealing\nwith a second-order crisis. It’s not the disease itself, but the measures taken\nto combat it that are threatening prosperity. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Was that different in the past? \nTooze: I have\nstudied the files from the time of the Spanish influenza in 1918 in great\ndetail. It’s really interesting: From a medical standpoint, the crisis at the\ntime was much worse. It primarily hit young, working people. The Treaty of\nVersailles was negotiated in the midst of the epidemic, the war economy was\nbeing wound down and the postwar order was being shaped. Around 50 million\npeople died globally, but it was hardly a major political issue at the time,\nexcept when U.S. President Woodrow Wilson fell ill. \nZEIT\nONLINE: One could also view it as a civilizational step forward\nthat more focus has been placed on the suffering of the victims. \nTooze: I would\nsee it as a crisis of modernity. A hundred years ago, there was no welfare\nstate in the modern sense, and the government didn’t feel the same\nresponsibility for public health. Hospitals didn’t play the central role in\nlife and death that they do today. Our medical capacities and expectations\ncreate a completely new environment for making decisions: Do we risk the lives\nof millions of people? Or do we allow the global economy to slide into a\ndepression? It still isn’t clear to many people how close we came to a\nfinancial meltdown in March. \nZEIT\nONLINE: How so? \nTooze: Financial\nmarkets anticipated the economic consequences of global lockdowns and panicked.\nThat was the third-order crisis. People just started selling everything, even\nabsolutely safe investments like German government bonds. The only reason there\nwasn't a crash is because central banks intervened far more massively than in\n2008. They have literally flooded the world with liquidity, particularly the\nFederal Reserve, which responded extremely precisely and quickly, thus ensuring\nthe global supply of dollars. \nZEIT\nONLINE: We should see the Fed as a kind of benevolent world\neconomic government? \nTooze: I'm certain\nthere are far-sighted people in the Fed who want to do their best for\nhumankind. But in concrete terms, this is about the global nature of the American\nbond market. The Fed wants to prevent foreign investors from selling their\nbonds due to a shortage of dollars. This in turn stabilizes the international\nfinancial markets. I believe that this crisis will reinforce the U.S. monetary hegenmony.\nEven under an isolationist president like Donald Trump, investors can be\ncertain that the central bank will do what is necessary. This will strengthen\nthe dollar as the world’s reserve currency. \nZEIT\nONLINE: That would be bad news for those in Europe who want to\nestablish the euro as a competitor in order to break American dominance on the\ncurrency markets. \nTooze: Europe\nwill emerge financially weakened from this crisis. The impression from outside\nis that, even in the face of a challenge of this nature, not everyone is\npulling together. Why would long-term investors want to do business in euros?\nThe pandemic is relentlessly exposing the design flaws in the monetary union. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Still, European Union finance ministers did agree last week\non 500 billion euros in aid for member states in need, including access to the\nfunds in the European Stability Mechanism, the euro-zone’s backstop. \nTooze: The ESM\nis a product of the euro crisis, and its loans were tied to strict reform\nconditions. Even if these conditions are now to be relaxed, it is still\nconsidered politically toxic in large parts of Southern Europe. The crisis\nmakes clear that ultimately, in the absence of any real political agreement,\nthe monetary union will be held together by monetary infusions from the\nEuropean Central Bank. It is buying up eurozone bonds on a grand scale and\nthereby keeping interest rates low. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Just as the United States is doing. \nTooze: But with\none crucial difference. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve’s interventions are\nclosely coordinated with the U.S. Treasury. The crisis package passed by\nCongress includes $454 billion to cover possible losses made by the Fed. The\nsituation is similar in Britain, where the Bank of England is now financing the\nstate directly. In a state-controlled monetary system, the central bank also\nhas to make its contribution in fighting the crisis. That’s the philosophy. But\nin Europe, this has a politically destabilizing effect. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Why? \nTooze: Because\na different logic applies in a monetary union. The ECB is responsible for 19 countries,\nnot one. This means that, in principle, transfers from one country to the\nothers can be organized through the central bank’s balance sheet. \nHowever, that isn’t compatible with the concept, pushed\nthrough above all by Germany, of the eurozone as being a community of states\nthat are largely responsible for their own fiscal policies. That’s why the ECB\nis legally prohibited from providing direct financing to member states. And it\nleads to a bizarre situation in which the central bank has to justify its\nactions with all sorts of flimsy arguments. Then the critics from Germany come\nand say: That’s all nonsense – we’re going to take this to the German Federal\nConstitutional Court. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Is it nonsense? \nTooze: Of\ncourse, it's nonsense. The bond purchases result in a mutualization of risks. That\nis a fact. And this puts the Constitutional Court judges in a position where\nthey must produce circuitous arguments to give the ECB carte blanche, because the\neuro would probably be history if the German high court were to declare the ECB's\npolicy to be illegal. And then, Berlin can claim that it didn’t have to\nsurrender the fiscal sovereignty of the Bundestag. It’s a Hall of Mirrors. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Your argument is that it's not an honest approach? \nTooze: Yes. It\nreminds me of the German position on security policy. The Germans say: We want\nsovereignty, but we are not prepared to bear the cost of it – in the form of\nhigher military spending, for example. And then, when that stupid Trump\npresents us with the bill, we look the other way. The people at the ECB are\nexperts. They know what they are doing. The German government relies on the\nfunctional effectiveness of these measures, but in return, it accepts a spiral\nof political de-legitimization that come along with them.  \nZEIT\nONLINE: Why is that, do you think? \nTooze: I think\nit has something to do with the obsessive focus on the status quo. You tell\nyourself: Everything is going just fine, and as long as we maintain the\nappearance that all is well, we don’t have to worry. But there are people who\nare concerned. This results in the opening of a flank at the center of society\nfor the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany, which exploits this\nweakness with relish. \nZEIT\nONLINE: What would you suggest? \nTooze: I would suggest\nputting an end to the deception. The Europeans should issue common bonds,\ncorona bonds, to help overcome the crisis. \nZEIT\nONLINE: But the AfD would also seek to exploit that decision. \nTooze: Certainly.\nBut if you believe in democracy, you must at least try to find majorities for such\na deepening of Europe. That is my criticism of Angela Merkel and of German\nfinance minister Olaf Scholz. I know he understands it. And I know that smart\npeople on his staff also understand it. So, why doesn’t he say: I trust my\npowers of persuasion and I am prepared to put my career on the line for this. I\ndon’t think Germans are dumb. You can explain things to them. \nZEIT ONLINE: Scholz\nwould probably say: Why take this risk if there’s another way? \nTooze: I think\nthat’s too short-sighted. Following the initiative taken by nine European\ngovernments for corona bonds, it is no longer possible to pretend that the\nissue isn’t on the table. You have to think of it as a long-term relationship. Things\nare going pretty well, but then the question arises: Should we get married? That’s\nprecisely what this initiative is, at least figuratively speaking. If you then\nanswer \"no,\" as the German government does, there is no return to the\nstatus quo. It’s a different game then. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Perhaps it’s a mistake to ask the question at all. \nTooze: That may\nbe. That is something for future historians to judge. Perhaps they will arrive\nat the conclusion that it's the kind of activism that is not untypical of\nEmmanuel Macron. The impression right now is that Germany has decided to leave\nFrance, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland in the lurch. In situations\nlike this, you have to be conscious of the historical dimensions. \nZEIT\nONLINE: The German position is being harshly criticized, especially\nin Italy. Rightly so?\nTooze: I can at\nleast understand it. It's a distortion of the facts to say that Italians just\nthrow their money away. Italy has been practicing austerity for practically a\nquarter of a century. With the exception of the 2009 crisis, the Italian state\nhas generated budgetary surpluses for the past 25 years, if you deduct interest\npayments made to service sovereign debt. \nZEIT\nONLINE: That debt still exceeds annual gross domestic product. \nTooze: But it's\na legacy of the 1980s and '90s. The present generation cannot be held\nresponsible, and not in the moral sense either. The country is now being\ngoverned by people with whom a deal should be made. The problem is that there\nis much greater suffering in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe – and\nthis, too, is related to the monetary union's design flaws. In severe\ncrises, investors park their money in Germany, where it is considered safe. But\nmoney is pulled out of countries like Italy. This results in completely\ndifferent world views. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Did Helmut Kohl overestimate German solidarity when he\nintroduced the euro? Or, put another way: Should the common currency have been\nintroduced at all? \nTooze: Helmut\nKohl viewed himself as a historical figure and historical figures are gamblers.\nIntroducing the euro was a huge risk. Even at the time, it was possible to see\nthat further steps toward integration would be necessary for the monetary union\nto work – and that the approval of the German population would be needed. But\nthat was of no interest to Kohl. But it was also a risk for other countries. They\ngambled on the fact that the Germans would be prepared to make concessions. This\nmade conflict inevitable.   \nThe battle that France and Italy have won is the battle for\nthe ECB. It was conceived as a copy of Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank,\nbut it hasn't been since the presidency of Mario Draghi. This bothers\nconservatives in Germany and makes further progress on the European budget and\njoint bonds even more difficult. \nZEIT\nONLINE: A weakened Europe and a stronger U.S.: Will this be the\ngeopolitical result of the crisis? \nTooze: The U.S.\nhas been strengthened in one particular area: monetary policy. Otherwise, the\npandemic has hit the American societal system at its weakest point: the health-care\nsystem. Opinions may diverge over the American labor market, with its virtually\nnon-existent protections against dismissal, but it works. Unemployment is\ncurrently rising at a breathtaking rate, but it will also fall relatively\nquickly, if the economy bounces back. \nThe health-care system is a different matter. It’s not\nworking. It is obvious that China and other Asian countries have dealt with the\ndisease better, even if there are doubts about the numbers the Chinese are\nproviding. This will not be without consequences. The crisis will further\nstrengthen the feeling that an Asian Century has dawned. The only Apple Stores\nin the world that are open right now are those in China. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Could there be a renaissance in welfare-state thinking? \nTooze: For the\nU.S., at least, The New Deal candidate was Bernie Sanders, and he’s now out of\nthe race. For the American left, this marks the end of a history that began\nwith the Occupy Wall Street movement. However, it could be that a shift of that\nkind will take place unexpectedly. When 17 million Americans lose their jobs in\njust three weeks’ time, nobody knows what is going to happen. Or what happens\nwhen a state like Michigan suddenly has a 25 percent unemployment rate. And it\nwill get worse. The interesting thing is that the aid packages that have thus\nfar been agreed upon are comparatively socially balanced relative to the\nRepublicans’ recent tax cuts. The assistance is more than just gifts to the\nrich. They are financed by huge deficits. \nZEIT ONLINE: That\nmeans more debt. \nTooze: And it\nis likely that these debts will be used by conservatives to justify drastic\nausterity measures. The debts accumulated today will be the cross to which any\nform of welfare-state policy will be nailed. I believe that progressive forces won't\nbe able to get around a new approach to the issue of debt. You have to be\nfrank: Public debt is conceptually different from private debt. You don’t have\nto pay it back. If necessary, you can simply park it in the Fed’s accounts and\nleave it there. And there’s one politician who understands that extremely well. \nZEIT\nONLINE: Who? \nTooze: Donald\nTrump. For him, money is something the banks magically conjure up. and he is\nthe chief magician. \nTranslated by Daryl Lindsey\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for length and \nclarity.
