     "article": "German politicians start to discuss a nationwide curfew. 10.000 infections in Berlin expected by next week. The Tagesspiegel Checkpoint Coronavirus update. Freiburg: First Large German City Under Curfew\nIn the US: Highest International Travel Warning Imposed \u2013 Health Emergency Imminent in New York \u2013 Indefinite Curfew in California\nThe Coronavirus is hitting the U.S. hard and two governmental decisions on pausing international flights suggest this disruption could go on longer than originally thought. Yesterday afternoon the State Department called all U.S. citizens abroad to come home immediately or prepare to remain in place for an indefinite period of time. \nAn urgent \u201cdiscouragement against international travel\u201d was issued, which is the strongest travel warning there is. Later in the evening, California imposed an indefinite curfew. The health situation in New York City was called explosive, with 4000 infections. \nThe actual number is expected to be significantly higher due to low testing-rates at the beginning of the crisis. However, the city has not yet been locked down.\nSoon More Than 10.000 Infected Expected in Berlin\nAt yesterday\u2019s special sitting of Berlin\u2019s senate it was only Health Senator Dilek Kalayci who was in favor of a very rapid curfew. However, Berlin\u2019s Mayor Michael M\u00fcller had also mentioned this as a possibility. The number of registered infection cases in Berlin rose by a third within one day, now counting 688. \nBut it is estimated that those numbers are a week behind and that in reality, case numbers are higher. If the rate of infection continues to grow at it\u2019s present rate, by tomorrow we will have crossed the mark to 1000 infected, and next week we\u2019ll reach around 10,000. Just in Berlin. In case you\u2019re wondering where a stroll could lead you these days: go donate blood! \nThis is even more urgent, as the German Red Cross (DRK) has had most of their contact points closed. Ask a German-speaking friend to help you call the hotline and find out where you can donate (if you are healthy and over 18 years old): Hotline 0800 1194911.\n\nBerlin\u2019s Senate to Provide Emergency Relief of \u20ac600m\nThe Senate last night announced an Emergency Relief package for businesses, solo-entrepreneurs and freelancers with a total value of \u20ac600m. Of which \u20ac100m are set aside for small businesses (Kleinstunternehmen) with a staff of up to five employees. \nThe need will have to be proven, and information on how to obtain this aid will be published within the next days on the Berlin Investitionsbank\u2019s website. Larger companies can also expect (relatively) unbureaucratic support. We will keep you posted here.\nThe Chamber of Commerce (IHK) Starts Hotline and Daily Newsletter on Berlin\u2019s Econom\nThe IHK describes the situation of Berlin\u2019s economy as \"devastating\". There is talk of \"widespread desperation\". After yesterday\u2019s mentions of the hotlines that provide info and assistance by the Investitionsbank, Visit Berlin and Berlin Partner, the IHK has now also established a line and mails out information for companies and businesspeople. \nUp to 3000 calls from entrepreneurs were registered daily. The number is (030) 3151 0919, email: corona@berlin.ihk.de. The newsletter is in German only, and you can sign up here: https://www.ihk-berlin.de/corona-newsletter\nHospitality Businesses Already Insolvent\nSome of what Berliners and their guests usually eat in restaurants is now delivered on bikes. But it is not enough to save the hospitality sector: School caterers for example fear for their businesses but many local restaurant owners are in fact already insolvent, like owner and chef Bj\u00f6rn Nitz who wrote to the Tagesspiegel:\u201cPlease officially close the restaurants and impose a curfew!\u201d, he begs both state and federal governments: After two of the weakest months of the year now, March sales have gone down by 90 percent. Savings are already gone and it is impossible to continue payments for the staff or operating costs. \u201cWe can no longer pay our bills, nor electricity, nor the rent!\u201d The house bank is unable to offer help without binding commitments from politicians.\nThe State Authority for Health and Social Services (LaGeSo) to Stop Issuing the Berlin Pass and Severely Handicapped Pass\nThis is also important: For now, the Berlin Pass (i.e. the S(ocial) Ticket) will no longer be extended but will remain valid even after expiration. According to the LaGeSo, the pension office is currently forced to suspend processing and delivering of the severely handicapped pass. The administrative number 115 can be reached for general questions.\nPolice Register Almost 100 Infringements Against the Infection Protection Law\nTagesspiegel Checkpoint reader Ulrich P. thinks that announcements by loudspeaker could make the seriousness of the situation clearer to ignorant people. When asked, the police say they prefer personal conversation to disperse groups of over 50 people in parks, but are prepared to use loudspeakers if necessary. \nAnd on the subject of acceptance: During the night on Thursday, 154 clubs, restaurants, bars, shops, etc. were checked. 97 were believed to have violated regulations, 59 were closed, and twelve criminal charges were filed.\nIllegal Sales of Protection Materials\nA Charlottenburg shop offering \u201cmedical hygiene materials\u201d opened its doors yesterday and was forced to close immediately afterwards, as the sale of disinfectant, protective masks and single-use gloves were illegal. According to the staff, some of the goods apparently came from medical practices.\nBerlin AfD Chief Spreads Fake News About Coronavirus\nSpreading fake news is a matter for the head of Berlin\u2019s AfD (Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland): Georg Pazderski posted a video on Twitter allegedly showing teenagers sharing a lollipop. His comment: \u201cTeenagers without empathy, stupid rich kids that take to the streets on Fridays for #FFF, blame the older generation for jeapordising their future and now show how far their horizons actually go.\u201d The video is from October 2019.\nJoin the Applause, Saturday at 7pm\nAnother appointment for the weekend: More and more people are calling to follow the Italian example of showing gratitude to all those bravely continue to serve the public good in the fight against the Coronavirus. On Saturday, you\u2019re invited to step out onto your balcony (if you have one) or open the window at 7pm and give a round of applause!\n\n\"Schnee von morgen\"\nThis is a nice one because now we enter the land of proverbs. You know the expression \u201csnow from yesterday\u201d? When something is old news? Well, the Tagesspiegel Checkpoint is giving away tomorrow\u2019s snow. A snow glass ball. A classic Berlin souvenir. Yes this might be sentimental kitsch, but it\u2019s also important to have something lighter to end the current information with, don\u2019t you agree? \nToday is the beginning of spring! So we\u2019re giving away a miniature \u201cLittle Big City\u201d complete with shiny fake snow, the Brandenburg Gate, Oberbaum Bridge and the TV Tower to someone who by Sunday has sent us a homemade spring poem (minimum 4 lines) to checkpoint@tagesspiegel.deThe winners shall decided by the 8-year-old daughter of today\u2019s Checkpoint writer Stefan Jacobs. The best contributions will be published on Monday, when we are back with Checkpoint. Until then, stay healthy, flatten the curve, stay inside and help your neighbours.",
