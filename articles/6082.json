     "article": "The biggest difference between November 3rd, 2016 and November 3rd, 2020? Fear. The historian Timothy Snyder on the US election and what happens in the country.\nTimothy David\nSnyder is is the Richard C. Levin Professor of History at Yale University and a\npermanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna. In his 2017 book\n\"On Tyranny,\" he provided a guide for resisting authoritarian regime change\nthat is used the world over. His most recent book, \"Our\nMalady: Lessons in Liberty from a Hospital Diary,\" will be published in\nSeptember.\nLesen Sie das Interview auf Deutsch.\nZEIT ONLINE: Professor Snyder, in your forthcoming book,\nyou describe your experience with the American health-care system. What was it\nlike?\nTimothy Snyder: I was very ill and I was in the emergency room\nfor a very long time before anything happened. The doctors made a series of\nmistakes which almost killed me. I was in several different hospitals, but by\nthe end I was in one close to home. I thought I would be well taken care of, or\nthat at least I would understand the flaws of the system. I didn't, though. Afterwards\nsome colleagues berated me because I did not call on powerful patrons to help\nme when I was in the emergency room. I was shocked by this open admission by\nAmerican elites that our hospitals don't really function unless you have\nprotection. Medicine should not be a matter of patronage or oligarchy. It\nshould simply work.\nZEIT ONLINE: That sounds dramatic. \nSnyder: It takes some work to explain this to\nEuropeans or Germans. It's a little like speaking a different language. When\nyou inside an American hospital, you have to think differently and constantly be asking yourself: Are\nthe doctors and the nurses doing this for a reason that has to do with health,\nor are they doing it for a reason that has to do with money? When I am in a\nhospital in Germany or in Austria, I might be dissatisfied with something, and\nindeed sometimes I am. But honestly, in Europe I am never worried that money is\nguiding the process. And so the whole mood is different, and in a way that has\nto be beneficial for health.\nZEIT ONLINE: How do you explain the difference?\nSnyder: The fundamental problem with the American\nhealth-care system is that it is commercial, it is based on profit. This means\nthat everyone is affected by this, not just bodily but also morally. We are all\ndemoralized, because even those of us who have some access to health care know\nthat we have it at the expense of others. Especially during this pandemic, we\nare seeing how this affects American life. Roughly half of Americans feel they\ncan't go to the hospital because they cannot afford it. Without sick leave or\ndecent unemployment compensation, we cannot keep the ill out of the workplace\nduring an epidemic. Since we lack the basic idea of public health, a crisis\nlike the coronavirus is all the more deadly. There is no national mechanism to\ncreate an emergency response, whether it is about testing or anything else.\nWhat my own time in the hospital revealed to me, and what the coronavirus has\nrevealed on a national level, is that a purely commercial medical system is\nalways going to fail in times of crisis.\nZEIT ONLINE: What does the broken health-care system tell\nus about the state of democracy in the U.S.?\nSnyder: It tells us many things. Our flawed health care\nmakes democracy harder, and our flawed democracy makes health care harder. American\ndemocracy is compromised by racism in the very basic sense that it is harder\nfor people who are not white to vote. This makes building a welfare state more\ndifficult. Republican politicians tell white Americans that we can't have a\npublic health system because only black people and immigrants would profit from\nit. And the lack of a functioning welfare state creates a great deal of fear\nand anxiety. This in turn pushes us towards authoritarianism and away from\ndemocracy. You can watch on the news right now as the president seeks to\ntransform all of this entirely unnecessary fear and death into the emotional foundation\nfor the shift toward authoritarianism. \nZEIT ONLINE: These are all problems that the United States\nhas been facing for several decades. Now, on top of all that, Donald Trump is\nsitting in the White House. In you book \"On Tyranny,\" which was published 2017, you warned that\ndemocratic institutions may not be able to defend themselves. Three years\nlater, everything you predicted seems to have come true.\nSnyder: Sadly, things have unfolded in the United States essentially as I expected they would. The consensus in the United States\nin late 2016 was that the institutions would defend themselves. I didn't\nbelieve that, which is why I wrote \"On\nTyranny.\" I wanted Americans to take individual responsibility for\ncivic affairs and to try to rebuild the institutions while there was time.\nObviously, things are much worse today than they were in 2017. Inequality of\nwealth is worse. Access to local news is worse. Racism is clearly worse, both\nagainst African Americans and against immigrants. \nZEIT ONLINE:Donald Trump is openly hinting that he might\nnot accept the result of the election in November. What would happen if he was\nto refuse to leave the White House despite losing?\nSnyder: I guess he would have to sleep in the guest\nroom.\nZEIT ONLINE: That sounds rather optimistic.\nSnyder: I was just trying to make you laugh.\nSeriously, Donald Trump is not a democrat. He does not actually like\ndemocracies. And he has said dozens of times that he does not accept the\noutcomes of elections. He has made it abundantly clear that he should be allowed\nto decide who wins and who loses. So when Donald Trump talks about possible\nelectoral fraud, he wants to create an atmosphere of chaos surrounding the November\nelection. Basically, everything he has said and done since summer is about\nchaos: the idea that we are experiencing riots in our cities; the idea that you\ncan't trust mail-in voting, even though that's the most reliable way to do it.\nHe is hoping that he can somehow emerge from that chaos as president. \nZEIT ONLINE: The Black Lives Matter protests have been\naccompanied by looting and violence …\nSnyder: It would be such a good thing if we could\nstart a sentence with the word \"Black\" and finish it without using\nthe words \"looting\" and \"violence.\" I took part in those\nprotests, as I have taken part in protests since the beginning. The protests, which\nI think have been inadequately covered in Europe, are  the largest expression of American civic\nresistance since the 1960s and have been largely, indeed overwhelmingly,\npeaceful. The hundreds of small protests all throughout the country do not get\nnoticed. Only when something burns do we take photos and pay attention. These\nprotests are actually showing that a population can be mobilized for a moral\ncause even during a pandemic. \nZEIT ONLINE: Do you think the institutions in America are\nprepared for a president refusing to leave office?\n\n\nSnyder: They're not prepared, but they are preparing\nand they're preparing on both sides. There are lawyers who are preparing the\nlawsuits. And there are politicians who are trying to make sure that the right\nkind of majorities can be assembled in the House of Representatives. Ahead of\nNovember and in November, there will be a clash, there will be disorder for a\ncertain period of time. But I think in the end, it will be clear that Joe Biden\nhas won. Unlike in 2016, when I was one of the very few people warning that we\nwere facing a crisis of institutions in 2020, that the next election could be\nthe last more or less normal one, everyone on the democratic side is now aware\nthat this election is about regime change and not just about one candidate\nversus another.\nZEIT ONLINE: How long will it take to get Donald Trump out\nof office?\nSnyder: In many countries, you have a new president or\na new prime minister just a few days after an election. But that is not the way\nour system works. We have an election in the first week of November and then a\ntransfer of power in the third week of January. It is important that American\nand also foreign journalists cover this the right way. Trump will claim, and is\nalready claiming, that if we do not know the outcome on election day, then we\nhave a crisis. This is self-serving and wrong. It is not true that we have to\nknow the projected outcome of the election on the day people have voted. It is\njust a luxury which we are used to having. The truth is: The formal outcome of\nthe election is decided in December, so we have five weeks to count all of the\nvotes. (Editor's note: December is when\nthe Electoral College votes for the new president and vice president.)\nZEIT ONLINE: The potential\nlegal and political battles after the elections are one thing. Another thing is\nwhat is happening on the streets of the U.S.. Donald Trump managed to get armed\nsupporters inside the Michigan State Capitol with just a few tweets. How severe is the\nrisk that violence will break out?\nSnyder: Unfortunately, Donald Trump is begging for\nviolence. And unfortunately, there will be violence. In Kenosha a young man has already killed protestors. Americans are not better or worse\nthan anyone else in this respect. If you look at the history of Europe and\ncontested elections, especially in the first half of the 20th century, violence\nwas very common. Donald Trump, as you quite correctly suggest, believes that\nviolence will help him. He knows that he is going to lose the election at the\nballot box. At this point, he is not even trying to win in the conventional\nsense.\nZEIT ONLINE: Donald Trump is no longer interested in\nwinning?\nSnyder: He is interested in dying in his own bed,\npreferably in the White House and not in prison. I that sense, he is an\nutterly typical authoritarian. I mean that he\nis not trying to get the most votes, because he knows that he cannot. If he\nwere trying to win by getting the most votes, the Republican National\nConvention would have been much more centrist rather than being so radical. Donald\nTrump wouldn't be constantly rallying his base, including its extremist\nelements. He would be using conciliatory language, trying to convince people in\nthe center. But he is not doing that at all. The reason is that he has given\nup. He is now trying to gather enough people on the streets and in the\ninstitutions in the hope that somehow things will turn out in his favor after\nthe election. \nZEIT ONLINE: Some have discussed the possibility of a civil\nwar. Are such concerns exaggerated?\nSnyder: I don't think there will be anything like a\ncivil war. Donald Trump's supporters, although often angry and often armed, are\nnot organized in the same way, let us say, that the Heimwehr in Austria was\norganized in the 1930s. \nZEIT ONLINE: So following a few weeks of uncertainty, a\nhandful of lawsuits and maybe some civil unrest, everything will return to\nnormal?\nSnyder: Look, it is senseless\nto try to predict in detail, because what happens depends on how people behave\nbetween now and then. The best we can do is explain the real risks in the hopes\nthat others take precautions. If we say now that we know what will happen, that\nis like saying there is no reason to act. And of course we have to act: We have\nto vote, we have to organize, we have to mobilize, and we have to prepare those\nlawsuits that you mentioned. I don’t think that we will return to normal as\nsuch. It will hopefully be a time of dramatic change. Because as you said at\nthe very beginning of the interview, Donald Trump is only part of the problem. He\nhas only made the existing trends from the last 40 years worse. Which means\nthat the next administration has to start by addressing the trends of the last\n40 years.\nZEIT ONLINE: What should a Biden administration tackle\nfirst?\nSnyder: First of all, the Democrats don't just have to\nwin the White House, but also a majority in the Senate. Assuming they will be\nable to achieve that, the most important piece of legislation is one which the\nHouse of Representatives has already tried to pass: cleaning up American\nelections. We have huge problems with our elections: The districts are all\nwrong, there is too much money in politics, 25 of the 50 states have electoral\nrepression laws, and Election Day is a Tuesday, when many have to go work\ninstead of casting their vote.\nThe second\nmost important thing is inequality. Massive inequality of wealth between\ncitizens creates the sense that Americans are not living in the same country.\nInequality of wealth has to be addressed by higher taxation: We are not taxing and\nauditing rich people right now, we are only taxing and auditing the middle\nclass. Not just in the IRS but throughout the government, the people who should\nbe enforcing the rules are insufficiently funded and are unable to take on the largest\ntargets. The big internet companies should be broken up and taxed to support\nlocal news: Indeed, one massive inequality we are currently facing is that of\naccess to relevant information. And racial inequality has to be addressed by\nallowing all people to vote and by continuing a national conversation about our\nhistory.\nZEIT ONLINE: Are we making the same mistakes as in 2016,\nwhen many were so sure that Hillary Clinton would win? Is the same thing\nhappening with Joe Biden's candidacy? \nSnyder: That is a good question to ask, but the\nnumbers are really very different this time. In 2016, Hillary Clinton's lead\nwas around two, three or maybe four percentage points. And Clinton was doing\nreally poorly in the swing states. Biden's lead now is eight or 10 points, and\nhe is doing well in most of the swing states. It is unusual to have this big of\na gap between the two candidates. \nIn 2016,\npeople were ignoring the data showing that Trump really had a chance. People\njust refused to believe it because they were caught in their own bubbles.\nToday, everyone is wondering the same thing that you are asking. Democrats are\nasking themselves: Are we being too complacent this time? Last time, the\nSanders faction and the Clinton faction felt like they could fight among\nthemselves because everyone took for granted that Clinton was going to win.\nThey were not afraid in 2016. They are afraid this time. \nZEIT ONLINE: You sound very confident.\nSnyder: I think Donald Trump is probably more\npolitically gifted than I am. And he has made clear that thinks that he has\nlost the election conventionally. So I'm just going to trust his judgment on\nthis. ",
