Here in France, about one-third of the economy is practically paralyzed. There are forecasts that gross domestic product will shrink by around 8 percent this year. A similar or even greater decline is also expected in other European countries, especially in Italy or Spain, partly because of these countries\u2019 dependence on tourism. \n\nLars Feld:As an export nation, Germany is more likely to be affected by the weakening of foreign markets. In March, we expected Germany\u2019s economic output to contract by 2.8 percent. At the time that forecast was made, we assumed that the standstill would last for five weeks and that the economy would then be brought back to life over a three-week period. That assessment proved untenable. I am now anticipating a decline of closer to 5.5 percent, and even that is optimistic. \n\nMartin:But there\u2019s also good news. From a financial point of view, the economy is less out of balance than it usually is in severe crises. It was shut down to fight the pandemic. That distinguishes this crisis from the global financial crisis of 2008, for example. If we can manage to build a bridge to get through the standstill relatively unharmed, there could be an upswing again afterward. This is precisely why European solidarity is so important. \n\nZEIT:What do you mean by solidarity? \n\nMartin:Building such a bridge costs money. To take one example: You have the Kurzarbeit worker furlough program in Germany. It\u2019s a very sensible regulation that safeguards jobs. However, not all countries are able to borrow fresh money as cheaply. And the countries that are particularly fragile financially, like Italy or Spain, are also the ones that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. At the European level, we must prevent a situation in which these countries are no longer able to provide economic support to their companies because of a lack of money. \n\nFeld:But we also can\u2019t forget that some of these things are already being done. The European Commission has launched a subsidy program to finance short-time work. Finance ministers have agreed that the European Investment Bank should also step in to help prop up financially vulnerable companies. And we have the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). If the costs get out of control, the countries in question can also apply for a loan there. \n\nZEIT:You are referring to the eurozone crisis fund. Strict conditions, such as debt reduction, are normally attached to ESM loans, which deters many countries from using it.\n\nFeld:Such requirements make little sense in this crisis, because it is not the result of political mistakes made by the countries. That\u2019s why finance ministers have agreed to provide the affected countries with access to a credit line with very few conditions attached. I think that is the right way to go. \n\n\nMartin:Lars, you need extremely favorable conditions for such a loan to help these countries. The loans need to have very long maturities; I think 30 years would be appropriate. And interest rates would have to be low. \n\n\nFeld:That can be done. The ESM itself can borrow money cheaply and pass that advantage on to the countries. The good thing about this approach is that when a country places itself under the ESM\u2019s rescue umbrella, the European Central Bank (ECB) can buy up that country\u2019s government bonds in an almost unlimited manner. This provision is provided through the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program that was introduced under former central bank president Mario Draghi, but it has so far never been used. \n\nZEIT:Ultimately, European taxpayers are liable for the ESM and the ECB. Critics say this would essentially be the back-door equivalent of turning the monetary union into a transfer union. \n\n\nFeld:I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but sure: A loan like the one we discussed would contain a transfer element. Italy, after all, would have to pay higher interest rates on the free market than if it borrowed the money from the ESM. \n\nZEIT:You could live with that? \n\n\nFeld:In this situation, I have no problem with it. A monetary union is, of course, always has a certain degree of shared liability. If you want to help a highly indebted country like Italy, it won\u2019t be possible without some kind of transfer. The question is how you structure these transfers \u2013 and how comprehensive they are. I do find it problematic, though, when people say: We have to use everything we have at our disposal right now. I am opposed to the kind of joint bonds being discussed under the term corona bonds. \n\n\nMartin:It\u2019s a problematic term because everyone has a different understanding of what it means. \n\nZEIT:Then let\u2019s look at the details. In a newspaper interview on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it\u2019s \"common debt with a common guarantee\" that is needed. Would that be necessary from your point of view, Mr. Martin? \n\n\nMartin:Yes. The countries affected need to be able to obtain favorable financing in order to shore up their economies. This can only work through common debt, regardless what you call it in the end. I am in favor of a temporary reconstruction fund which, backed by joint guarantees from the member states, borrows money on the capital markets and then uses this money to finance projects \u2013 with a focus on the states hit by the crisis. The important thing is that the main criterion for the distribution of funds should be the needs of the member states. The advantage to this is that, unlike the ESM loans, the fund\u2019s outlays would not be counted as sovereign debt. In the case of Italy, this would be advantageous because the country is already heavily indebted. \n\nZEIT:Can you understand why people in Germany say: If the Italians had saved more, they wouldn\u2019t be dependent on help from others. \n\n\nMartin:The fact is that they have been saving. Fiscal policy in Italy was stricter than in France. With the exception of the 2009 crisis, Italy has consistently generated budget surpluses for the past 20 years, once interest expenditures are deducted. The ratio of sovereign debt to gross domestic product is as high as it is because there has been little growth in the Italian economy \u2013 and not because the Italians have been piling up more and more fresh debt.\n\n\nFeld:But growth doesn\u2019t just fall from the sky. The problem in Italy is low economic productivity. This is also due to the fact that the Italian government has often set the wrong priorities in fiscal policy. In this respect, the government cannot be completely absolved of its responsibility. Belgium also had a very high public debt ratio in the 1990s. Since then, though, it has gone down by 31 percentage points. But in Italy, it has risen by 18 percentage points. We are spending a lot of money right now to combat the crisis, but we also need to be looking at how to stabilize the Italian debt ratio \u2013 otherwise the problem will get out of control. \n\n\nMartin:I would love to talk about how we can get growth moving again. But I would warn against a premature debate on new austerity programs. That would be a mistake from my perspective. Recent years have shown that austerity policies will not reduce the debt ratio in these countries. It just doesn\u2019t work. \n\nZEIT:Mr. Feld, why are you opposed to the issuing of joint bonds to finance the recovery?\n\nFeld:On this issue we must be extremely precise. I have a problem with joint and several liability. Joint and several means: one for all. With a bond like that, any creditor could demand complete amortization and interest payments from any debtor. Germany would then be forced to collect the portion owed by other member states. The problem is that it would be possible for member states to pass their own payment obligations on to other countries. The result would be a community fund but without joint control over disbursement. That would be a political powder keg for the currency union.\n\nZEIT:Methods could be found to defuse such tensions.\n\nFeld:That would only be possible through the extensive transfer of sovereignty rights to the European level, which would then implement solid fiscal policy. I don't see a willingness to do such a thing, nor is it clear to me that such a centralization of decision-making powers would be successful on the whole. \n\nZEIT:Would a fund of the kind sketched out by Philippe Martin be an option for you?\n\nFeld:If it did not have joint and several liability, then it would be a possible path forward. But I would warn against anchoring it in the European budget, as is being discussed. It would then become a permanent mechanism and would be the equivalent of transferring additional competencies to the European level.\n\nZEIT:That may be intentional. In U.S. history, the central government's assumption of debt amassed by the states was a significant factor in the country's development.\n\nMartin:That wouldn't work in Europe. Politically, the EU is neither fish nor fowl. It is neither an alliance of nations nor is it a federal entity. We have to find our own way.\n\nZEIT:Does it bother you when people like Lars Feld are constantly popping up with their concerns about liability and control?\n\nMartin:No. I even think that we in France should also place greater emphasis on the debate regarding the democratic legitimization of European decisions. To take one example, it is remarkable that there was almost no disagreement between us regarding the bailout of Greece, despite the fact that France at the time took similar risks as Germany, relative to economic output \u2013 and I say that as someone who was in favor of supporting Greece.\n\n\nFeld:I believe the differences in viewpoint are also related to the fact that Germany is a federalist country, in contrast to France. In the relationship between the German central government and the states, many of the conflicts and competing interests become apparent that can also be seen in the interaction of member states at the European level. There, too, arguments frequently focus on who is responsible for paying the bill. It is something that shapes German politicians.\n\n\nMartin:But you also have to realize what a refusal to pay would mean. If we were to refuse any form of support and Italy was not successful in stabilizing its own economy, would Germany or France be better off? Of course not. On the contrary, we would then be facing a new sovereign debt crisis with new losses for everyone. For me, solidarity is thus an investment \u2013 and it is one with a high return. It is in our interest to prevent an economic catastrophe for the EU. And the reality is: People in the south feel as though Europe has left them in the lurch. If we don't help, there is a danger that populists will be strengthened and Italy will leave the currency union.\n\n\nFeld:We just have to be careful that we don't end up boosting the populists in the north instead. That is why a sense of proportion is vital. In Germany, the truth is that rising public approval ratings have put Chancellor Merkel's conservatives in a political position where they can push through economically sensible measures. The political capital that has been amassed can now be deployed.\n\nZEIT:Mr. Martin, Mr. Feld, Germany and France have long been considered the motor of European integration. Is that still the case?\n\nMartin:In France, there are concerns that this crisis too will lead to Germany and France growing apart politically and economically. But I think we should be more worried about the fact that unity between Germany and France is no longer sufficient to keep Europe together. It is a common challenge to lead other member states to a productive compromise as well. The Netherlands has adopted the British position to a certain extent, but without the economic heft and strategic vision of the British. They are vigorously resisting joint initiatives. And on the other side, the Italians are demanding even more extensive financial concessions. \n\n\nFeld:It is always said that Europe develops further in times of crisis. My impression is that this is a technocratic view. We are getting closer and closer together, but it is a process that takes time. I would say that Germany and France are closer together today than 10 years ago, despite political differences of opinion.\nTranslated by Daryl Lindsey and Charles Hawley\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.
