Hairdressers close, hardware stores remain open. Chancellor Merkel in quarantine. Your daily Coronavirus update by Tagesspiegel Checkpoint. From now on, excerpts from Checkpoint, Tagesspiegel's daily Berlin newsletter, will be provided in English. You can find it Monday through Friday from 11a.m on the Tagesspiegel website. We will update you on all relevant Coronavirus and Berlin news for free. Please recommend the English Checkpoint to your friends, colleagues, fellow students, and all non-native speakers of German who live in the city (learn more about the German edition here). Translation: Kathleen W\u00e4chter, Lily Coates\nBerlin Mayor M\u00fcller Declares His Position on ZDF\u2014and Avoids a Lockdown\nHairdressers Forced to Close, Hardware Stores Remain Open\nThousands Return Unchecked From Egypt to Berlin\nGermanywide, 24,000 people are currently infected with the Coronavirus (status Sunday evening). 92 have died, 266 have recovered. In Berlin, there are 1100 registered infections, although the numbers are thought to be significantly higher, as seven of the city\u2019s 12 district offices had not transferred their data to the senate in time by Sunday evening, according to \u201cMorgenpost\u201d.\nMoreover, up until Friday about 6000 travelers from Egypt returned to TXL and SXF without any controls, according to \u201cBerliner Zeitung\u201d. In view of a 3 \u2013 14 day incubation time, it is foreseeable that the infection curve will raise dramatically into April and in the absence of new evidence, any fundamental discussions on the glaring limitations will, by then, likely be superfluous.\nSecond Death in Berlin Confirmed\nOn Monday, another fatal case of Covid-19 in Berlin had been confirmed. The deceased was 70 years old. This was the second death related to the Corona pandemic in Germany\u2019s capital. In the end of last week, a 95-year-old with multiple pre-existing conditions had also died from the Coronavirus disease. With that, the country\u2019s overall death toll rises to 87.\nRescue Personnel and Doctors Increasingly Affected\nIn recent days, thankyou messages addressed to those working in the health sector have been left at various hospitals and even on a bridge above the A100 freeway (two had to be taken down by police as they weren\u2019t secure). As Vivantes Clinics show, rescue service resources are already beginning to shrink. Against the recommendations by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the clinic\u2019s personnel will not go into quarantine after having been in contact with infected, but will continue working in protection gear. Fire services are also showing growing cracks: Seven firefighters have tested positive and 123 are currently contained in quarantine. And: rescue personnel is now advised to reuse protective masks multiple times.\nStricter Speed Limits to Avoid Accidents and Injuries?\n\u201cDonation Fences\u201d and Neighborhood Help Initiatives on the Rise\nSome Shops Have Prepared, Others Haven\u2019t\nNo Risk of Infection From Newsprint\nThe association of publishers, BDZV, has addressed the question of whether Coronavirus can be spread via newspapers. The answer, according to the State Institute for Risk Assessment and the state\u2019s chief virologist Christian Drosten: no such case is known, and dry surfaces are generally not suited to the transmission of the virus. This applies both to newsprint and banknotes. Nevertheless, paragraph 1 of the precaution naturally applies: don\u2019t forget to wash hands! \nEconomists Give Tips for Working From Home \nNow that the Tagesspiegel segment \u201cBerlin Economy\u201d (published weekdays) is produced from the home office, a new series is dedicated to exactly that: how to make it in the home office. In the premiere, Stefan Franzke, Berlin Partner CEO has plenty of experience working from home and offers tips like this one: dress up so you\u2019re aware you aren\u2019t on holidays but on duty. Yes, insight into other peoples realities has always been part of the pleasure being a journalist.\nPolice Cheer People up During Curfew \nWe will probably see more of the Police now, when we\u2019re are outside or at our windows. And perhaps we can expect scenes like those from our European neighbours, in Brussels for example, where a patrol car was observed playing the chanson \u201cReste \u00e0 la maison, m\u00eame s'il y a le printemps qui chante\u201d through their loudspeakers (\u201cStay at home, even though the spring is singing\u201d).\nLocal police in Algaida (Mallorca, Spain) played a serenade and danced for the residents before they left in an electric car (by the way). It\u2019s time someone came up with an international hashtag for these sweet videos. They\u2019re like medicine during the Corona curfew and like the daily online evening concerts, they lift the spirits.\nNo Relief for the City\u2019s Understaffed Police\nBerlin Police are experiencing severe overtime. At the end of last year, 1.9 million extra hours were clocked, according to \u201cMorgenpost\u201d, an increase of 200,000 hours within 6 months and more than 500,000 compared to autumn 2018. Doesn\u2019t look like there is any sign of relief.\nThe Poetic Awakening of Spring\nCheckpoint readers, you\u2019re awesome! Almost 20 springtime poems were sent in, remember we did a call for entries last Friday? Two of them in English, several written by kids and generally wonderful to read. Thank you very much! The Jury has had a tough time deciding, but after hour-long deliberations at the table in the kids\u2019 room (the jury consisted of the 8 y.o. daughter of today\u2019s Checkpoint author) two winners were chosen. \nTwo German entries made the race of words (and won a magical glass snow dome) and we\u2019ll leave them in here, why not? Now is as good a time as any to try out your German. Find the English contributions afterwards (however, they won\u2019t come with the prize, sorry!)\nHere also two of the English contributions:\nWishing you a good and healthy start to the week!", "twitter-history": "[{       \"id\": 1242440417385332736,       \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/MiBLT/status/1242440417385332736\",       \"date\": \"2020-03-24 13:17:33+00:00\",       \"text\": \"@askashdavies @ferdy182 @lehtimaeki @JorgeCastilloPr @hhariri Not that, but other social consequences.
