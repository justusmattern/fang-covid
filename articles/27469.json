Police on the streets (and in supermarkets), strategies to cope, and how to help others. Monday to Friday at around 11am, an English translation of Checkpoint, Tagesspiegel's daily Berlin newsletter, will be provided on the Tagesspiegel website. We will update you on all relevant Coronavirus and Berlin news for free. Please recommend the English Checkpoint to your friends, colleagues, fellow students, and all non-native speakers who live in the city (learn more about the German edition here). Translation: Kathleen W\u00e4chter, Lily Coates\nBerlin is standing still. As it must. Yesterday, 300 police officers were on duty to ensure the contact ban ordered by the Senate is being respected.\nThe report: 145 places (and some groups of people) were checked upon, 37 were closed and 43 criminal investigations initiated. \u201cAlmost everyone in our city adheres to the regulations, accepts the necessary and sometimes very severe restrictions, shows solidarity and responsibility\u201d, police spokesman Thilo Cablitz told Checkpoint last night.\nBut: there remain some individuals who appear to be unbothered. \u201cA virus doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s nine out of ten who protect themselves and others. One irresponsible person is enough to cause damage and in the worst case, could cost many lives. In order to avoid this, we are taking to the streets to follow up with infringements for those who still don\u2019t want to get it\u201d. Penalties include fines and imprisonment.\nGermany now counts 31,906 people infected with the Coronavirus. Berlin\u2019s infections stand at 1,219, 47 of whom are being treated in hospitalised isolation and 22 in intensive care. Two Berliners (70 and 95 years old) have died.\nHealth Minister Dilek Kalayci requested that all residents older than 70 years adopt self-quarantine measures. \u201cDistancing is the most effective protection from the Coronavirus infection. The help of friends, relatives and neighbors is now needed in order to assist with provision and care, always keeping a minimum distance of 1.5 metres. You can remain social even while keeping your distance.\u201d\nSeems the people in Schmargendorf have not comprehended the concept of 1.5 metres distance (Berliner A \u2013 1.5 metres \u2013 Berliner B \u2013 1.5 metres \u2013 Berliner C). Police were called three times on Monday because the Edeka in Berkaer Street was overfilled and no space was kept between shoppers. As those inside appeared to have only themselves in mind, police officers at one point took over the door. The supermarket owner found this stupid and closed the store. There will be a new attempt to open again today. Hopefully among the assortment: brains and heart.\nThere\u2019s too little space for too many people. Currently also a problem for public transport. In response, the BVG will get more trains on the tracks as of today. Special vehicles will be sent if CCTV shows busy waiting platforms. What else could be done? Let\u2019s look at how the others do it: The Mayor in Colombia\u2019s capital Bogot\u00e1 passed a temporary decree in order to bring ease into public transport by turning 117 kilometers into bike lanes from 6am to 7.30pm. How about a copy+paste, Berlin? \u201cWe\u2019re discussing this\u201d, wrote Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain\u2019s district mayor Monika Herrmann on Twitter. It\u2019s not so much a question of \u201cif\u201d, but of \u201chow\u201d.\nHow can we get urgently needed protection gear to medical practices and clinics? The Federal Ministry of Health promised masks on Monday, however only 8,000 were delivered. The Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung (KV; Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians) responded with criticism and broke it down in numbers: one mask per practice. Not even the Senate knows when the next delivery can be expected. \u201cPerhaps we haven\u2019t made this clear enough\u201d, the KV writes, \u201cthat without this protection, practices will have to close.\u201d Meanwhile in Bavaria: More than 800,000 protective masks and 235,000 bottles of disinfectant was distributed to hospitals and medical practices.\nThe \u201cBazooka\u201d \u2013 this is what Federal Minister for Finances Olaf Scholz (SPD, also Deputy Chancellor) calls the Corona Aid Package, announced on Monday. The cabinet has set aside a sum of \u20ac122.5 billion to help individuals and businesses. Solo entrepreneurs and small businesses are set to receive financial aid of \u20ac9,000 to \u20ac15,000.\nFurther decisions were made on Kurzarbeitergeld (short-time work compensation) and protection against eviction for renters who cannot pay their rent due to a cut in income stream. Parents who can\u2019t go to work because their children need to be cared for at home due to Kindergarten and school closures shall receive a monthly state compensation of \u20ac2,016.\nAt the same time, in an open letter to Berlin\u2019s mayor, 159 restaurant owners have called for compensation for damages and losses resulting from the Corona crisis. \u201cIf we don\u2019t receive access to financial aid as easily and as quickly as possible, many of our staff and colleagues will not be able to make it through April\u201d.\nThis current situation is a pack of exceptional circumstances and is asking a lot of us. To cope with the fear that can naturally come with it, the German Association for Psychology has put together a list of 5 tips. \n1. Stay informed - but the right way! Use trustworthy sources of information and avoid an excessive consumption of media. \n2. Design the day in a positive way. Routines help to keep an inner stability, so try to eat and sleep at the same time each day. \n3. Exchange and help one another: A call, a message or letter can mean a lot and send an important message: \u201cYou are not alone\u201d.\n4. Accept negative feelings and support the positive ones. From a psychiatric-psychotherapeutic standpoint, allow your emotions of being overwhelmed, of stress and sorrow. At the same time, one can try and aim to concentrate on what creates positive feelings, like the coffee in the morning or listening to music. \n5. If you feel very unwell: seek professional help!\nIf you would like to help somehow, our colleague Robert Klages has put together an overview of the \u201cdonation fences\u201d for those homeless and in need (feel free to check and add): \nPlease spread, participate and add information. Let\u2019s show our solidarity, Berlin!\n\nAlthough the Government has flown 120,000 travellers back to Germany, more than 80,000 are still waiting to come home. Checkpoint reader Mechthild is stranded with a small group of fellow travellers on Bohol island in the Philippines. From there, she needs to get to the international airport on the neighboring island of Cebu, where all planned return flights are cancelled for the time being.\n\"The German Government is working hard on new alternatives\", the embassy's website says. \u201cI am shocked and speechless\u201d, Mechthild writes. She had been advised to buy a ticket herself. The cost is around \u20ac2,000, but there is no guarantee the flights won\u2019t be cancelled. Pandemic chaos in paradise. \n\u201cGet those orders out\u201d, is the current request from the Building Trade Association. On Monday, the signal came from several districts that the almost empty schools could facilitate speedy construction. At the same time, construction companies that have lost orders due to the current rent cap as well as the corona crisis are offering their services. If not now, then when? \nThe freshly built Student Housing Village in Schlachtensee (built according to sustainable principles!) has free spaces due to cancellations from foreign students. Students, this is your chance for a room \u2013 starting at \u20ac300! Applications open for students of all universities www.studentendorf.berlin.\nThere is a prediction that more rooms and flats could return to the residential rental market in the form of unused AirBnB lodgings. According to an Irish rental agency, flats and room offers have gone up 64 percent in Dublin since the outbreak of Coronavirus. As it happens, Berlin has more than 26,500 official AirBnB lodgings (as of 2018).\nIn Brandenburg, four men were arrested after police received a tip from Austria. They were found to be in possession of machine pistols, revolvers, grenades, ammunition, fuses and a bazooka from the Second World War.\nIn addition, Wehrmacht steel helmets and ashtrays with SS runes were found on a 27-year-old. All men made extensive confessions upon their arrest.
