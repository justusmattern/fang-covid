He\u2019s now worried it may go under. \nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nHow are our European neighbors doing in the pandemic? What is life like these days in France, Ireland, Bulgaria and elsewhere? In the series \"We Neighbors,\" Europeans will be talking about their everyday lives: the taxi driver in Dublin, the mother in Paris working from home, the theater family in Bulgaria. They are also all taking part in Europe Talks, a discussion event for which ZEIT ONLINE, together with media partners from 15 countries, is registering participants. On Dec. 13, thousands of people from across Europe will meet another European to discuss and debate the corona crisis.\nMy theater has 400 seats, making it the largest private stage in Sofia. Our offerings are of a more commercial nature, with stand-up comedy and shows like \"Caveman.\" We earn money exclusively from live audiences; we can\u2019t do theater for the elite the way state theaters that get money from the government can. Until March, we had around 20 shows each month, but then we had to close without any advance warning. We never got the money we were promised by the government. Things are also looking bad for the coming season. It\u2019s getting to the point where I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \nThe government was very strict during the first lockdown between mid-March and the end of April. You were only allowed to leave home to buy groceries. That was it. On the one hand, this led to Bulgaria having extremely low numbers up until the fall. That\u2019s good.  On the other hand, though, it has also led to extreme suffering in the cultural scene. \nThat\u2019s why us theater people had a meeting with the culture minister. We were told that the government was going to help everyone. That there would be money from the EU and that the government also had its own money available. We were told not to worry. So, we sent our applications to the ministry, but not one of the private theaters received even a single cent. We were strung along. \nOnly recently, I got a call from the ministry. \"Did you apply for money?\" they asked. \u2013 \"Yes.\"\"Did you get any money?\" \u2013 \"No.\"\"Did you notify us about the fact that you didn\u2019t get any money?\" \u2013 \"No.\"\"Why not?\" \u2013 \"Because I don't want to hear from you anymore! Just leave me alone!\"\nWhile the rest of Europe experienced a first wave of the coronavirus, tough containment measures ensured that Bulgaria escaped the worst. But this fall, the number of infections rose sharply there too, and the country has been in partial lockdown since the beginning of December. Private gatherings are limited to 15 people. Daycare centers, schools and other educational institutions are closed, as are gyms, movie theaters and museums. An exception has been made for theaters, which are allowed to fill to up to 30 percent of their capacities. \n\nThe government said it had to implement the tough lockdown measures in part due to the comparably high mortality rate in the country. Health Minister Kostadin Angelov has blamed this on the fact that many people have tried to recover on their own and only went to the doctor after it was too late. Bulgaria also has a high rate of heart disease, an underlying condition that can exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms. The country is now placing its hopes on a vaccine. The government in Sofia has already presented a vaccination plan with five phases. Vaccinations in the country are to be voluntary and free of charge. \nI\u2019ve had it. I\u2019m not waiting any longer for them to help us. We have to get through this on our own. And I know that from my own experience: I've always managed somehow!\nOur theater is in an old building from the 1950s. It used to be the House of Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship. Bulgaria was a close ally of the Soviet Union. Even as a child, I would go to the theater \u2013 and I loved it. But I didn't have the courage to act myself. My father was an engineer, so I applied to study engineering too. I even started university. But I was drawn straight into the university theater group. The director told me to apply to drama school because I was so good. It worked on the second try and I completed my training in 1988. \nOne year later, democracy arrived, chasing out communism. Acting wasn\u2019t something you could really make a living on at the time. Salaries were really bad. So, I sold cars, computers, insurance, everything really. Around the turn of the millennium, I founded a production company for commercials, but what I actually wanted was my own theater, where I could stage whatever I wanted. So, I started my theater in Sofia. \nI\u2019ve been managing the Th\u00e9atro for four years now. It wasn\u2019t easy going at first and I didn\u2019t know if it would work. But things finally started looking good in March. For the first time, it seemed like things were working. A great wish had become reality \u2013 until the pandemic suddenly arrived. \nI was skiing in Austria at the time; there still hadn't been a single case in Bulgaria. A staff member called and said: Dimitar, as of today, your theater is closed. Without any advance warning. From one day to the next. No, actually it was from one day to the same day. \nI think the government sees private theater people as enemies. We can do and say whatever we want. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t like us. We have a corrupt and criminal government that cares only about itself. The only thing they care about is how they can steal from people like us. We protested against them in the summer. Against corruption and for an independent judiciary and free media. Tens of thousands took to the streets, as did I. New elections are scheduled for next March. They will try everything to manipulate the vote, but the protests have given me hope that we can still change something about this shitty government. \nThe propaganda message they disseminate is: Oh, God, we\u2019re all going to die. The hospitals are overwhelmed. That's true, but it's not because we have so many coronavirus cases. It\u2019s because we lack doctors and nurses. These are jobs that nobody wants to do in Bulgaria because they are so poorly paid. My family and I all infected each other with the coronavirus. Fortunately, we didn\u2019t have particularly severe cases and we didn\u2019t have to depend on the hospitals. The fear of the disease was, at least for us, worse than the physical symptoms. \nI\u2019m fortunate for now that my landlord isn\u2019t expecting any rent for the theater at the moment. Otherwise, I would have been out on the street by now. But I also don\u2019t know where things will go from here. Should I stage theater online as a stream? That\u2019s not really theater, not at all. Theater thrives on the performance and on interaction with the audience. It needs to take place on the stage, not on the internet.\nI\u2019m fortunate in that in addition to the theater, I also have a production company that shoots commercials. That\u2019s still going on. Advertising has the advantage that it doesn\u2019t have to be live to be effective. \nI could have reopened the theater in the summer, first with 30 percent of the seats and later at even 50 percent capacity. But the theater season in Bulgaria runs from September to May. No one goes to the theater in summer. They normally come back in the fall, but not this time. In October, I had a play with very prominent actors in my theater, Assen Blatechki and Malin Krastev, absolute top people. Andrey Rossinski, a director from Moscow, was immensely popular in Russia with his own theater. He couldn\u2019t stand Putin, though, so he moved to Bulgaria ten years ago. Performances like that normally would have sold out months in advance. But I only sold 30 tickets for the premiere. People are afraid. They don\u2019t want to go to the theater. That won\u2019t change in the winter either, I\u2019m afraid. \nI\u2019m pinning my hopes on the vaccine. It will take away people\u2019s fear. I\u2019ve been thinking about commissioning a play about the pandemic and we could stage it once people have been vaccinated, once this is behind us. I would like it to be a dark comedy. But please, no tragedy.\"",
