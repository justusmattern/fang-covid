     "article": "We shouldn't get distracted by the U.S. president. The mob that attacked the Capitol is part of a global movement that will survive him \u2013 in America and here in Europe.\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nIt is true that a simple one-to-one\ncomparison between political dynamics in the United States and Europe is\nimpossible. That is especially true of the right wing and right-wing radical\nmovements, which have completely different traditions and influences in the\nU.S. than do their European counterparts. Religion, the welfare state,\nhomosexuality \u2013 positions on those issues tend to be diametrically opposed\namong right-wingers on opposing sides of the Atlantic. And a figure like Donald Trump would likely have trouble generating much of a following in Europe, just\nas Viktor Orb\u00e1n would be similarly shunned in the U.S.\nStill, the storming of the U.S. Capitol\nisn't purely an American affair. The political desolation in the U.S. was\ntriggered by the same storm that is also raging in Europe.\nThe attack of violent Trump followers on U.S.\nlawmakers last Wednesday was the most striking operation thus far seen from a\nglobal movement which, despite the personality cult that has developed around\nthe U.S. president, would continue to grow even if Trump would suddenly decide\nto devote the rest of his life to fighting global warming. Trump only\ncultivated and harvested that which has been successfully and rapidly growing\nfor quite some time in many other societies in the white West.\nIn the U.S. as in Europe, right-wing\nextremists have increasingly radicalized and militarized in recent years, while\nat the same time becoming frighteningly acceptable to milieus that are actually\nmuch more moderate. These right-wing extremists, in the U.S. as in Europe, are\ngranted legitimacy far too often by opportunists within the democratic spectrum\n\u2013 usually conservatives, but also economic liberals.\nHow great, really, is the difference\nbetween U.S. Congressmen who repeat Trump's lies about election fraud, and\nGerman politicians who allege that there is no true freedom of expression in\nGermany? Both claims validate right-wing radical assertions that democratic norms\nno longer exist. The logical conclusion drawn by many is that if democracy\ndoesn't exist, they then have the right to install one. With whatever means\nnecessary and against all resistance.\nThe result of this narrative, there as\nhere, is something which is the precise opposite of democracy: An element of\nthe societal center \u2013 plagued by fears of social decline and angered by demands\nfrom marginalized groups to have a say \u2013 are willing to accept almost any political\nnarrative, even in the middle of a deadly pandemic, as long as it doesn't come\nfrom the \"establishment.\" Whether it be the sweeping rejection of\nmeasures aimed at coronavirus protections or claims that a group of child\nmolesters is seeking to dominate the world and only Donald Trump is standing in\ntheir way.\nIn Europe and the U.S., this narrative is\nsupplied by a well-oiled, attention-grabbing machinery made up of political market\ncriers, sect leaders, D-list celebrities and right-wing radicals who crop up as\nreal-estate moguls, ordinary bureaucrats, cabaret artists or intellectuals \u2013\nall of whom are following the same gospel: You, the silent white majority,\ncannot rely on the mercy of your oppressors. You must take back your country.\nAnd this gospel now dominates a significant portion of political life in many\nWestern societies.\nEven if many radical right-wing politicians are now distancing themselves from the event -- including J\u00f6rg Meuthen, the co-head of the Alternative for Germany, who described Trump's speech in the run-up to the riots as \"inexcusable\" - what happened at the Capitol is consistent with this gospel and is closely related to that which right-wing extremists and their allies have been pursuing in Germany for some time: Symbolic land grabs and demonstrations of power against democratic institutions. The point of such\ninitiatives is to illustrate fantasies of the approaching revolution, to\nproduce an atmosphere of threatening urgency when paired with ominously kitschy\nmusic in YouTube videos.\nWe saw that at the Reichstag in Berlin,\nwhere right-wing radicals stormed up the steps to parliament in late August,\nalmost producing images similar to those seen in Washington, D.C. last week. In\nLeipzig, too, where the violent nucleus of the corona-truthers overran the\npolice and forced their way into the city center. But the same thing happens in\nmuch smaller situations, such as the recent corona protests in the small town\nof P\u00f6ssneck in the state of Thuringia, where a few dozen demonstrators were\nable to briefly gain the upper hand against the police.\nThe fact that lawmakers and journalists\nwere forced to hide under tables, that an armed mob stormed up the stairs of\nthe Capitol and kicked in doors as Congress was in the process of certifying\nthe results of a democratic election, was yet another milestone for this\nmovement and its sympathizers \u2013 no matter if they are sitting in a trailer in\nUtah or at home in the state of Brandenburg in Germany. The message to all of\nthese followers is the same: The final battle between us and the supposed\ndictatorship is coming. Get ready, we can emerge victorious.\nYes, they feel like they can win. They sense\nthat they are having the kind of effect that they viewed as impossible just a\nshort time ago. They are feeling the \"Winds of Change\" \u2013 and such an\nexalted feeling isn't one that others can easily destroy. As such, it will\nprove impossible to slow this movement through compromise and reconciliation,\nas many still apparently envision. From freedom fighter to mainstream voter: That is a path very few will take. And why should they?\nThe most unsettling thing isn't just the\nright-wing radicals, but also those who tolerate them, here as in the U.S. Authoritarianism,\nas we have learned from history, doesn't necessarily need majorities to retain\npower or expand it. What it needs is fear among its opponents. Also helpful is\na growing feeling in the neutral center that an authoritarian takeover is\nultimately unavoidable and will then be lasting. And it needs security organs\nthat are prepared to join it in bending the constitution in times of crisis.\nAnd with that, we have arrived at the next problem.\nIn this aspect too, the attack on the\nCapitol was a signal. It could very easily have turned out to be a demoralizing\nevent for the right wing. If, for example, the state had clamped down\nsufficiently to intimidate or even humiliate the mob. If the attack had\nproduced images of Trump followers handcuffed on the ground or fleeing the\npolice. If, for example, the images from last Wednesday had been similar to\nthose produced last summer when the U.S. president scandalously had peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrators beaten and driven off just so he could pose with a Bible\nin front of a church.\nOn this occasion, though, faced with a\nviolent right-wing mob of wannabe insurgents, there was no sign of a highly\nmilitarized, highly motivated police force. Security personnel weren't just\ngrotesquely unprepared. They also pursued a strikingly lenient approach. The\nimages of violent perpetrators who were amicably helped out of the building\ninstead of being led away in handcuffs, or the pictures of assailants taking\nselfies with the police, are an additional message from the right-wing\nradicals. It is a message intended for their opponents: Are you certain that\nyour police will protect you when things get serious?\nHere, too, there are parallels between the\nUnited States and Europe. The security apparatuses, the armies, the secret\nservices, the police forces \u2013 let's be honest: Thus far, their assistance\nagainst the authoritarian wave has been limited at best. In Germany, the many\nreports of disappearing ammunition, secret prepper networks and racist WhatsApp\ngroups are cause for serious concern. And Washington has now shown with\ndisconcerting clarity how close right-wing radicals can come to realizing their\noverthrow fantasies if the police merely declines to confront them with the\nseverity required.\nThere is also hope, of course. It was also\npresent on that terrible day in Washington last week. It was the news that the\nstate of Georgia, long under Republican control, had followed up its support of\nJoe Biden in the presidential election by electing two Democratic Senators,\nthus handing Biden a majority in the Senate as well.\nThe deeper message of this result goes far\nbeyond the changing of the guard in the Senate. The victory in Georgia was made\npossible because the Black Democratic activist Stacey Abrams and her team have\nspent years mobilizing Black voters in the states \u2013 voters who had for years\nfaced numerous hurdles designed to prevent them from participating.\nWe shouldn't forget: As frightening and\npowerful as nationalist authoritarians look, they are a minority and they are\non the defensive. They are afraid of societies where groups that have thus far\nbeen marginalized are given an equal voice. They know that they only have a\nchance when those people who are victims of their racism are not heard, don't\nvote and don't participate in political life. If they are heard, if they do\nparticipate, then the situation drastically changes, in the U.S. as in Europe.\nThat is the opportunity we have to end the\nadvance of right-wing radicalism: a more open society that doesn't constantly\nlisten to the clamor of the right wing, working instead to ensure that all have\navenues to political and societal participation. Democracy itself, in its truest\nform, as a protector of minorities, is the best recipe against that which took\nplace in Washington. In both the U.S. and here in Europe.\nTranslated by Charles Hawley",
