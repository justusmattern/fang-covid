They hold contrasting opinions but find common ground nonetheless.\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nIn the summer of 2017, ZEIT ONLINE\ninitiated a project called Germany Talks. Thousands of people signed up to meet\nup with a neighbor who held contrasting political views for a face-to-face\ndebate. Since then, Germany Talks has taken place on a regular basis and more\nthan 60,000 people have taken part. On Sunday, May 10, thousands of people\naround Germany met up once again to discuss the consequences of the coronavirus\npandemic \u2013 this time via video chat. Reports on the event can be read here.\nStefan Wehner would like to talk. Not\nbecause he never gets the chance, but because he is hoping to meet someone who\ndoesn't see everything in black or white. Someone like his friend, who he used\nto meet up with every Sunday for a conversation before the coronavirus arrived.\nHis friend always seemed to have his mind made up about everything.\n\"With him, it's either yes or\nno,\" says Wehner, who has the feeling that he doesn't always get through\nto his friend. He wants to know what it feels like to actually hold a\ndiscussion with someone.\nThat's why he registered for Germany Talks.\nThe issue: the corona crisis. The call for participants noted: \"Germany is\ndebating the correct course in the crisis. Talk about it with someone who has a\ncompletely different approach than you do.\" Stefan Wehner, a 52-year-old\ntiler, is hoping to find someone who doesn't listen just to retort, but who\nlistens to understand.\nThat someone is to be Burkhard H\u00e4fner, who has\na Ph.D. in biology. For the 55-year-old, the decision to take part was a\nspontaneous one. He enjoys a good debate. Like all Germany Talks participants,\nH\u00e4fner and Wehner were sent a questionnaire containing seven yes-or-no\nquestions.\nAre the limits that have been placed on\npublic life commensurate? Wehner says yes, H\u00e4fner says no.\nShould data privacy laws be loosened to\nspeed up the tracking of infection chains? Wehner says no, H\u00e4fner says yes.\nDo you believe a nationwide requirement to\nwear masks is correct? Wehner is opposed, H\u00e4fner in favor. \nThey had opposite answers on all seven\nquestions.\nBut there is even more that divides them. Stefan\nWehner lives in a big city, Hamburg, while Burkhard H\u00e4fner lives in the\ncountryside between W\u00fcrzburg and Frankfurt. Wehner is married with an 8-year-old\ndaughter while H\u00e4fner is single and has no children. Stefan Wehner has lived in\nGermany his entire life; H\u00e4ftner has spent many years abroad.\nBut there is one all-encompassing issue\nthat the two of them share: cancer. H\u00e4fner has survived his bout with the\nillness and is now caring for his mother \u2013 who is suffering from it herself.\nWehner, meanwhile, will die of cancer, just as his grandmother and mother did\nbefore him. Wehner takes a palliative approach to the disease, with no hope for\na cure.\n\"I'm not afraid of death,\" says\nWehner. H\u00e4fner, who frequently sprinkles English into his speech, says:\n\"There is no escaping it.\" The corona crisis is, essentially, a\nmatter of life and death. And that's a subject in which H\u00e4fner and Wehner are\nexperts.\nA few days before their scheduled meeting,\nthe two of them exchange emails and agree to address each other using the\ninformal \"du\" form. They don't ask each other any questions in this\ninitial correspondence, nor do they write a word about corona. Instead, they talk\nabout themselves, inviting the other into their lives.\nThen they talk over Skype. At first, the\ncamera doesn't work and the sound quality is poor. But after 10 minutes, it\nstarts working.\n\"So,\" says Stefan, \"did the\nGerman government react correctly to the corona crisis? You answered with\nno.\"\nBurkhard: \"Essentially, I think they\nreacted correctly, just much too late. That is the criticism I have. It's not\neasy, of course, when you have only identified just a few infections. How can\nyou sell it to the electorate?\"\nStefan: \"I agree. Personally, I find\nthe measures appropriate, because you have to get the people behind you.\nOtherwise, it leads to divisions in society.\"\nBurkhard: \"Yes, right.\"\nAt this point, the discussion is still well-balanced,\nwith the two of them exchanging arguments about how where they think the German\ngovernment could have done better and where not, where they ran up against the\nlimits of what is possible and in what aspects they maybe should have done\nthings differently.\n\"Hindsight, of course, is always\n20-20,\" says Stefan. \"But when I look back at everything, I arrive at\nthe conclusion that we reacted correctly.\"\nBurkhard nods and suggests they move on.\n\"Question two,\" he says, \" Are the limits that have been placed\non public life commensurate? I answered no, but what I meant was not really.\nWhen you only have yes or no available as answers, it's hard to\ndifferentiate.\"\nBurkhard believes, for example, that the\nneeds of people in long-term care should have been considered to a much greater\ndegree. \"Many people were forced to die alone \u2013 and not necessarily from\nCOVID-19 \u2013 because no family members were allowed to visit them.\" Particularly\nfor those suffering from dementia, he says, the current situation is especially\ndifficult.\nStefan: \"No doubt about it. And I'm also\nnot so sure whether I could have found a better solution. But you simply have\nto minimize the risk of carrying infections into care homes. Of course, human\ntragedies are the result.\"\nThe limits on social contacts haven't\nchanged either of their lives to a great degree. Burkhard rarely leaves home\nbecause he takes care of his mother. Stefan says: \"At the moment, I hardly\ngo out at all. The last walk I took with my daughter was like an obstacle\ncourse. There were simply too many people out on the streets.\"\nAs he speaks, Stefan reclines into a large\ndesk chair, and he will spend the rest of the discussion in exactly this\nposition. Burkhard also doesn't shift position, though he leans forward on a\ntable, as though he is trying to see and hear better, as though he wants to\nkeep moving forward. The feeling that he is somehow in a hurry will last\nthroughout the entire discussion, though he always lets his counterpart say his\npiece. Only on those occasions when Stefan veers too far away from the issue at\nhand does Burkhard guide him back to the list of questions. He'll says\nsomething like: \"What was the next question?\" Still, they remain focused\non each other and they listen, asking questions like: \"How do you see\nit?\"\nCould such a thing have been expected? That\ntwo people who had different responses to every single question would\nnevertheless sit there nodding and smiling at each other?\nStefan increasingly takes over leadership\nof the discussion. It seems as though he wants to get it all out, all of the\nknowledge he has collected and prepared in his head. Perhaps he is also happy\nthat he has finally found someone who will sit there and listen.\nThe two agree that the government is facing\na challenge that isn't easy to solve. Stefan says that decisions for the entire\npopulation must be made with the goal of protecting as many people as possible.\n\"But our society is much too diverse to always be able to consider every\nindividual aspect. You can't protect everybody. At the same time, I have\nrealized that measures that are useful and enforceable in one area are\ncompletely impractical in others.\"\nBurkhard: \"That's true. You have to\nstay flexible and can't constantly insist on the letter of the law.\"\nLater, Burkhard will say: \"Stefan's\nperspective is more of society as a whole. It isn't so much one defined by the\nindividual and by the real worries he has, as it is with me.\"\nFrom personal experience, Burkhard is fully\naware of the concerns that people can have at the moment, concerns that have\napparently been completely overlooked by the government. Perhaps that is why his\nperspective is more focused on the individual. First, because of the pandemic, he\nwas no longer able to visit the people he was tending to as a hospice\nvolunteer. Not even their family members were allowed in. Then, when his mother\nrecently ended up in the hospital for a bone marrow biopsy, he wasn't able to\nvisit her either. \"That was very difficult for her,\" he says. How can\nyou explain such a thing to someone that old? \nStefan, though, says: \"After I came\ndown with cancer, it was important to me to no longer think from the\nperspective of an individual. I was over that. I know that I'm going to die no\nmatter what. I want to look at all of humanity.\"\nIndividual versus collective interests: Could\nthis contradiction contain the seeds of disagreement? No. The two of them don't\nargue, not once. \"When I view things from Stefan's perspective, I arrive\nat similar conclusions,\" Burkhard says. Internalizing another person's perspective\nis a skill. It's also something you have to want to do. And it's the only way\nto gain understanding for another person. It's the only way to compare someone\nelse's ideas with your own, to challenge them and perhaps to correct them.\nBut perhaps the fact that they don't argue\ncan be explained by the fact that at second glance, they actually have quite a\nbit in common. They both read the same kind of books \u2013 namely nonfiction focusing\non natural science or economics. They both spend a lot of time trying to\nunderstand context, to learn and develop themselves further. And such a thing,\nas they both know, is only possible when you listen.\nBut perhaps it also has to do with the fact\nthat both have gone through so much in life that they have no need for arguing.\nBurkhard, the biologist, lost his father in\n1991 to colon cancer. He then came down with cancer himself 10 years later as\nhe was working for a large pharmaceutical company in Belgium \u2013 on cancer\nresearch. In a 10-hour operation, surgeons didn't just remove the tumor but\nalso half of his tongue. Thanks to plastic microsurgery, they were able to rebuild\nhis tongue, and after two years of speech therapy, he no longer had\ndifficulties talking. \"Unless the weather changes,\" Burkhard says.\n\"Then, my scars harden and I have to choose words that I can still\npronounce well.\"\nThen, his mother was diagnosed with breast\ncancer. Burkhard quit his job and moved into his mother's house to take care of\nher and is still doing so today. \"It was my turn after my mother first sacrificed\nherself to take care of my father and then took care of me for six months after\nmy cancer surgery.\" Burkhard's mother, who is 88, survived her bout with\ncancer. But then, when the two of them were preparing a few weeks ago to\ncelebrate five years free of cancer, she was diagnosed on Friday, March 13,\nwith a bone marrow cancer. It was time to start all over again. More therapy,\nmore care. She now needs more help than ever, with everything. \"What is it\nthey say? That fate can be a lousy traitor? But whatever. Other people have\nother problems.\"\nOther people like Stefan, the tiler. He too\nhas cancer, as did his mother and grandmother, both of whom died from the\ndisease. \"My mother first came down with cancer in her mid-30s and then\nwas diagnosed with a new one every 10 years,\" he says. \"No doctor\nthought she would ever live to be 75.\"\nStefan's own cancer was found so late that\ndoctors could no longer figure out where it started. He was diagnosed with CUP\nsyndrome, which stands for \"carcinoma with unknown primary tumor.\"\nStefan's body is full of metastases and an operation isn't an option. He\nwouldn't be interested in one anyway, now that he has gone through myriad\ntreatments and the emotions and physical manifestations that have gone along\nwith them. Chemotherapy, for example: \"You can't really describe what\nhappens to you. Sharp pains in your entire body, nausea, exhaustion.\nConstantly. Basically, it feels like you're dying.\" Today, Stefan is no\nlonger fighting against cancer, he is living with it. For the last year, it\nhasn't changed, getting neither worse nor better. \"I'm content,\" he\nsays. \"At the moment, I really am content.\"\n\nBurkhard and Stefan know each other's story\nfrom the emails they exchanged prior to their meeting. Because such experiences\noften can't be described in words because of their intensity and complexity, it\nhelps to sit across from someone who has had a similar experience. It creates a\nfundamental undercurrent of understanding and compassion. A certain serenity is\nalso the result, with neither of them believing they are irreplaceable. \"You\nshouldn't take yourself too seriously,\" Burkhard says. Stefan says:\n\"The world will keep turning, whether I'm there or not.\" The only\nthing that Stefan really still cares about is giving his daughter the best\nstart in life that he can. \"We should use all the possibilities available\nto us to improve the future and our society,\" he says.\nNeither Stefan nor Burkhard cling to life,\nthey embrace it. The most important thing to them is no longer money, prestige\nor career success, but time. Time to read, time to think. They both know what a\nprivilege it is, particularly now at a time when each day brings more\ninformation and studies about the dominant issue of corona, all of which must\nbe filtered, read, understood and pieced together to gain something approaching\ncomprehension.\nStill, these two were chosen because of\ntheir opposing viewpoints on a number of issues that they have come together to\ndiscuss. And when it comes to the mask-wearing requirement, they aren't exactly\non the same page. Stefan is opposed to the requirement because most people\ndon't use them properly or they have a false sense of security when they wear\nthem and are no longer careful to keep sufficient distance from others.\nBurkhard concedes the point, but sees masks as having more of a symbolic\nimportance, because they can reduce people's fears of leaving their home and\nhelp them to feel more protected. At the same time, he says, masks are a\nconstant reminder of the dangers we are currently facing.\nThey are also at odds when it comes to online\nschooling. Stefan believes that the steps that have thus far been taken\nshouldn't be abandoned and that online activities motivate children to learn,\nperhaps even more so and more effectively than lessons in the classroom.\nBurkhard, though, says: \"Children already spend too much time in front of\nscreens. If evolution had wanted that, it would have given us telepathic\nabilities. Social competence is something that is best learned in interaction\nwith others, in face-to-face communication.\" They agree that a combination\nof the two would be the right strategy.\nThey continue talking \u2013 about the stock\nmarket, about the force of nature represented by this virus that cares nothing\nabout our economy, about technological developments and the future of humanity,\nabout the level of immunity in the population, about the importance of nuanced\napproaches, about the looming division of society. Neither of the two is\nseeking to score points in the discussion. They really are only interested in exchanging\nviews and finding out where the other's priorities lie \u2013 and what views result\nfrom that.\nPerhaps it isn't necessary to constantly\nargue. Perhaps the goal of such a discussion should simply be that of allowing\nthe space necessary to the complexities of life and to process them \u2013 or at\nleast to withstand them. \nAlmost two hours have passed by the time\nBurkhard suddenly is no longer looking into the camera, but past it. He is no\nlonger really listening. It is the only time that he interrupts Stefan in the\nmiddle of the sentence. \"Hey, I think I have to stop. You know why. My\nmother needs me. It was an interesting and wide-ranging discussion that I would\nbe happy to continue at some point.\"\n\"No worries,\" Stefan responds\nwith a smile.\n\"Be well.\"\n\"All the best.\"",
