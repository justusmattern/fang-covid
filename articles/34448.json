However, the term „case“ is twisted.\nBy editorial staff\nAbout 10% of the world’s population may have been infected with the coronavirus, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said, as the NPR reports.\nThis is an estimate far higher than the total number of confirmed „cases“ reported by governments worldwide. At the same time, it would mean that the majority of the world’s population is still vulnerable to infection and this pandemic is far from over, the head of the WHO’s emergency department, Dr Michael Ryan, said on Monday.\n„This varies from country to country, from city to city, from group to group,“ Ryan said. „But what it means is that the vast majority of the world remains at risk.“\nThe WHO Executive Board is holding a special meeting on Monday and Tuesday to review WHO’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe meeting will be held at WHO headquarters in Geneva and online, as the world has officially counted more than 35 million coronavirus cases and more than 1 million related deaths. But when the WHO estimates that at least 760 million people (i.e. almost 22 times more) were already infected with SARS-CoV-2 and considering that the vast majority of those who died had multiple co-morbidities, it also becomes clear that the danger of the virus is absolutely overestimated.\nOn the basis of these figures, it can be said that the lethality rate is therefore at a case of 760 infections. In total. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is at 0.13%. In comparison: for influenza (the flu) it is around 0.1%.\nHowever, the WHO twists the meaning of the word „case“. A simple infection with a virus alone does not constitute a case. An infection only becomes a case when it leads to the need for medical treatment because the human immune system is overwhelmed by it.\nInfections with noroviruses are an example of this. These trigger vomiting and diarrhea, especially in younger children and seniors over 70 years of age. By contrast, adolescents and middle-aged adults with a sufficiently functional immune system are hardly affected by such infections and rarely require medical treatment.\nFrom a medical point of view, there are many norovirus infections but significantly fewer cases, because not every infected person needs treatment. The same is the case with Sars-CoV-2, the cause of the disease Covid-19. Being infected with the coronavirus does not mean that you get sick. So then this is not a „case“, just an infection.",
