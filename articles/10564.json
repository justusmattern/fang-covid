Just how divided are they?\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nIn the summer of 2017, ZEIT ONLINE\ninitiated a project called Germany Talks. Thousands of people signed up to meet\nup with a neighbor who held contrasting political views for a face-to-face\ndebate. Since then, Germany Talks has taken place on a regular basis and more\nthan 60,000 people have taken part. On Sunday, May 10, thousands of people\naround Germany met up once again to discuss the consequences of the coronavirus\npandemic \u2013 this time via video chat. Reports on the event can be read here.\nHas the German government responded\ncorrectly to the coronavirus crisis? Have the authorities been sufficiently\ninformative and transparent? Do mask-wearing requirements make sense? To\ndiscuss such questions in one-on-one debates, thousands of people across\nGermany met up via video chat on Sunday, May 10, as part of this year's Germany\nTalks event. \nOver several weeks preceding the event,\nZEIT ONLINE and ZEIT \u2013 in cooperation with the Frankfurter Allgemeine\nZeitung, the Schw\u00e4bische Zeitung, the Rheinische Post, Chrismon\nand evangelisch.de \u2013 had invited their readers to take part. Almost 9,000\npeople initially showed interest, answering a total of seven controversial\nyes-or-no questions regarding the corona crisis. Around 6,500 people went on to\nconfirm their interest in participating in Germany Talks. An algorithm then\nmatched the participants up in pairs, with the goal of creating twosomes that\ndisagreed to the greatest degree possible on issues pertaining to the\ncoronavirus. They were then introduced via email.\nThe positions held by participants this\nyear were extremely divergent. The coronavirus has proven to be more polarizing\nthan any other controversial issue thus far addressed by Germany Talks events.\nOn average, the pairs created had different answers to 5.6 of the seven\nquestions. By comparison, in last year's event, which focused on issues like\nmigration, climate policy and equality, the debate pairs had contrasting\nopinions on an average of 4.5 questions. The year before that, it was 3.3\nquestions.\nOn none of the seven questions was there a\nclear majority for one or the other position. The clearest tendency was seen when\nit came to passing judgment on coronavirus policies as a whole, with two-thirds\nof participants saying they believed the government had reacted correctly to\nthe corona crisis. Around 63 percent believe the limitations on public life are\ncommensurate and 61 percent approve of the nationwide mask requirement. By\ncomparison, a representative survey found that 72 percent of Germans agree with\nthe measures imposed by the country's political leaders.\nThe group of participants in this year's Germany\nTalks event was slightly older than in past years, averaging 50.9 years old.\nOnly 31 percent of those taking part were women, and 68 percent men. Eastern\nGermans were also slightly underrepresented, as were people living in rural\nareas. The participant roster of Germany Talks was not representative, yet\ninteresting patterns can still be found in the information they provided and in\ntheir answers, which we analyzed anonymously\n\nWhen it comes to the details of the\ncoronavirus measures the have been put in place, there was significant\ndisagreement among Germany Talks participants. Half of them believe the same\nlimitations should apply to both younger and older members of society, while\nthe other half doesn't. The question about loosening data privacy laws to\nenable the more rapid tracing of infection chains proved to be similarly\ncontroversial, with 44 percent in favor and 56 percent opposed.\nDo men and women think differently about\nthe issues that the corona crisis has raised? Are people in eastern Germany\nmore skeptical when it comes to data privacy? Are younger people in Germany\nless fearful than the elderly?\nThe generational differences are complex. The\ngreatest degree of acceptance for the lockdown measures among Germany Talks\nparticipants was found in the under-30 demographic. Yet people over 65 also\nshowed a greater-than-average tendency to support limitations on public life and\nthe broad introduction of mask\u00ad-wearing requirements. The lowest level of\nsupport for conservative coronavirus policies was among 30-to-65-year-olds. One\nexplanation could be that people in this age group are more affected by work furloughs\nand the closures of daycare centers and schools. \nWomen tend to be more supportive than men\nof the coronavirus policies. They are also more likely to believe that\nlimitations on public life and mask-wearing requirements are justified. But\nwomen are more skeptical when it comes to data privacy. Generally, though, the\ndifferences between men and women proved to be smaller this year when compared\nto previous Germany Talks events. That is also true of the differences between\nother groups in society. As controversial as coronavirus policies have been,\nthe divides do not appear to run between urban and rural areas or between\neastern and western Germany.\nOn Sunday, May 10, thousands of\nparticipants met up via Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp or some other platform for a\nface-to-face discussion as part of Germany Talks, with some of them talking for\nseveral hours. For many of them, it wasn't just the technology that was\nunfamiliar. Discussing coronavirus policies was still so new for many\nparticipants that their arguments were still being formed and they had never\nshared them in a discussion before.\nIn contrast to previous years, this\niteration of Germany Talks brought people together who lived in different\nregions of the country, since the discussions were to take place via video chat\nanyway. It was thus the first time that people from Bavaria debated with people\nfrom the Rhineland, Saxons with Swabians, and Thuringians with people from\nHesse \u2013 focusing their discussion on the very different approaches taken to the\nvirus across the country and in their regions.\nIt is an opportunity for the discussions\nheld within the framework of Germany Talks, but also for the public debate\nabout how we should live with the pandemic in the future. Every participant\ncontributed with their arguments to coming that much closer to a constructive\nand respectful debate about the correct course of action in this crisis.", "twitter-history": "[{       \"id\": 1341681378795155457,       \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/rdeecke/status/1341681378795155457\",       \"date\": \"2020-12-23 09:45:42+00:00\",       \"text\": \"What Germany Is Arguing About in the Corona Era https://t.co/fUhvbBiaOn via @zeitonline\",       \"replies\": 0,       \"retweets\": 0,       \"likes\": 0,       \"quotes\": 0,       \"device\": \"<a href=https://mobile.twitter.com rel=nofollow>Twitter Web App</a>\",       \"poster\": {              \"id\": 196206018,              \"url\": \"http://robertdeecke.de\",              \"profile_pic\": \"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/969604019139334149/3_raKmTC_normal.jpg\",              \"profile_banner\": \"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/196206018/1520006489\",              \"username\": \"rdeecke\",              \"name\": \"Robert Deecke\",              \"description\": \"UX-Architect, Business Value & User Value tinyurl.com/XingRD tinyurl.com/LinkedRD Healthcare Futurist \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\",              \"verified\": false,              \"created_date\": \"2010-09-28 15:43:37+00:00\",              \"location\": \"Hamburg, Berlin\",              \"followers\": 273,              \"friends\": 429,              \"tweets\": 44656,              \"liked_tweets\": 11050,              \"lists_member\": 83,              \"media_shared\": 1288       }}, {       \"id\": 1276221429290319875,       \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/1014nyc/status/1276221429290319875\",       \"date\": \"2020-06-25 18:31:14+00:00\",       \"text\": \"The New Normal?
