The man charged with combatting the virus explains the Australian recipe for success – and what Germany can learn from it.\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nDIE ZEIT: Professor Sutton, you’re so\npopular in Australia that people are buying mugs, socks, ties and bedding with\nyour picture on them. Do you own any of them? \nBrett Sutton: No, I don’t. I am a\npublic health physician, I’ve done humanitarian work overseas but I have not\nbeen such a public figure previously. And so it is just a strange and rather comical position to be in to have\nthis strange attention. I think a lot of public health people have become\ncelebrities, either in a positive way or in a negative way, or both. And I\nthink I am in the category of both. There are people who are also very angry\nabout what we have been through and what we have experienced here in Melbourne\nand in Victoria more broadly. \nZEIT: What is the most important advice you have given since the outbreak of the\npandemic?\nSutton: I think the most important advice or request, or message of trust was that\nwe will get through this. It is going to be hard, it is going to be long, but we know where we are\nheaded and we are very clear where we want to get to. I think we have stuck to that\npromise. We had a short sharp lockdown, a circuit breaker, as we have called it, this last week\nafter an outbreak of 22 cases. But we have isolated the case, we have\nidentified all close contacts. It is very conservative, but it is with a view to again to being able to open up and go back to a relatively\nnormal life. \nZEIT: Was that the decisive factor in the long lockdown last year which lasted\nmore than 100 days? \nSutton: For us, it was clear that the rest of the country had achieved no\ncommunity transmission, and so, of course, we were reflecting on needing to\nprotect the rest of the country by getting to the same position. It was the\nonly sustainable strategy. If we don’t get to a point where you manage the few\ncases that might arise, then you are always dealing with social distancing,\nmask wearing, and a whole bunch of other restrictions on society that are\nprobably not sustainable in the long term.\nZEIT: Is a lot of testing being carried out in Australia?\nSutton: The testing per capita is very high. For my own state in Victoria, we have\ngot over 200 testing sites. They are mostly drive-through as well as being able\nto go to a local general practitioner and some hospital-based respiratory\nclinics. And for a population of almost 7 million, we have about 20,000 to 30,000\ntests per day, so, it is very high.\nZEIT: And when did you start testing?\nSutton: Right from the beginning. Victoria has a reference laboratory, the\nVictorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory, which was the first place outside\nof China to sequence the virus and create a test that allowed for PCR testing. Our PCR test was\nin place in January 2020.\nZEIT: You have probably seen that in Germany we are only now starting to carry\nout large-scale testing and a lot of people are asking why this has taken so\nlong. \nSutton: It took us a while to be able to scale up the testing capacity. It was\nliterally just in the hundreds for the first few months, and it would have\ngotten beyond us in March and April, if we hadn’t had a mandatory quarantine\nprogramme. But with the combination of those restrictions, the quarantine and\nthe testing, it was manageable. But I think the difference in Europe and North America is that cases continue to grow exponentially and the testing couldn’t\nkeep up with it.\nZEIT: You suspended international air travel, closed schools, only allowed\npeople to leave their homes to run essential errands and indoor socialising was\nbanned. How did you convince people that these tough restrictions were the\nright approach?  \nSutton: I think a fortunate aspect was that when we were asking that of\nVictorians, they had already seen that elimination was achievable in other states and\nterritories. I think the key components were that we were very clear with the ultimate objective which\nwas to be free of Covid in the community for the longer term. Daniel Andrews,\nthe Premier of Victoria reinforced those messages each and every day. The other\nelement that was very helpful was a modelling that predicted that we would be able to get to our threshold level for lifting restrictions on a certain\ndate. And then, everyone followed the numbers every day and could see that it\nwas more or less on track.\nZEIT: Looking back, what measures were the hardest to implement? \nSutton: I think people clearly struggled as you would expect with the social\nisolation. There are a number of people who lived alone normally and I think\nthe struggle was even more substantial for them.\nZEIT: Was there an increase in mental health problems during the lockdown? Or in\ndomestic violence?\nSutton: We saw increased calls to Lifeline which is the national number for people\nstruggling with mental health, suicidal ideation. We saw an increase in calls to\nthe domestic violence hotline as well. The true rate of suicide did not\nincrease during that period. Any suicide is one to many. We knew that there was\na psychological cost to it. But of course we were reflecting on what the\nalternative was, and if there was a need for repeated lockdowns, as Europe has\nexperienced, we knew that that would have had a toll at least as great.\nZEIT: But criticism of the government’s hard line has grown louder, for\ninstance, when 22 cases sent a whole state into a strict lockdown – an outbreak\nwhich would seem relatively harmless compared to the numbers in Europe. \nSutton: Every epidemic in every country started with one case, and of course, if\nyou have only got one or two dozen cases, you are not going to see deaths, you\nare not going to see your health system overwhelmed. But if you wait until your\nhealth system is overwhelmed, you will never get to a position where you can\ncontrol numbers in the long term again. Victoria has had 820 deaths in total\nand that is a real tragedy. But in a sense, there are many places in Europe and\nNorth America now that are so used to high numbers of deaths that they can’t\neven reflect on how tragic that scale of dying is. The day before this\ninterview I read a headline from the Daily Mail in the UK, calling for an end\nto the lockdown in England, and then I saw there were 500 deaths per day, and\nover 10,000 cases per day.\nZEIT: Is it possible to ‘live with the virus’ as has been discussed in Germany\nor does it have to be eradicated? \nSutton: The prospect of living with the virus is an awful alternative. It means\nhundreds of deaths and the long-term effects of long Covid that we are only now\nstarting to understand.\nZEIT: Could your strategy be followed by other countries?\nSutton: I think so. I do think that the lessons are probably that if you can have\na period of lockdown, of significant restrictions, to drive community transmission\nin the local area to a very low level, it allows the test, trace and isolate\nsystems to work. At the same time, I recognize that we are not talking about coming down from 675 cases a day for many countries. We are\ntalking about coming down from 10,000 or 15,000 cases per day. That would\nsuggest that you need maybe twelve months of lockdown to drive down to a\nsustainable level. So I don’t pretend for a minute that what we have done in\nVictoria or in Australia is necessarily applicable to Europe as a whole.\nZEIT: But...\nSutton: But I do think there must be places within Europe, within Germany, where\nthere are relatively low levels of transmission that could be driven down to zero. Strategically it\ncould be an option to have a strict restriction in place for movement in and\nout of the region. Australia has shown it can work.\nZEIT: But Australia is a sparsely populated country without any land borders,\nwhile Germany is much more densely populated and in the middle of Europe. \nSutton: There is some truth in it but it is not the whole story. It is also the\ncase that Thailand and Vietnam which have land borders and very dense\npopulations have also managed to end community transmission. I am sure that\nGermany’s mobile population across a relatively small geographical area\ncompared to Australia probably makes it harder to lockdown individual areas or\nregions. Australia does have a high population density within its state and\nterritory capital cities but we have still been able to manage internal\nborders.\nZEIT: A group of scientists is now calling for Germany to adopt the Australian\napproach and follow a ‘No Covid strategy’. What do you think of this idea? \nSutton: So again, I think that there are now very significant challenges with\nthousands of cases per day and it may be that it would simply take too long to\ndrive down numbers to a sustainable level. And it may be that getting\nvaccinations rolled out faster, more substantially to the at-risk population is\ngoing to achieve those objectives faster than a lockdown would. But I think\nthere are probably some regions where this approach could be applied, where\nregional borders internally and formal quarantine systems would work. I think\nyou need a mix of different measures to combat the consistently high levels of\nnew infections.\nZEIT: In Germany the ‘No Covid strategy’ is often countered with a number of\narguments which I would like to discuss with you. The first one is: it’s\nimpossible to ensure everyone complies with these strict rules.\nSutton: I would disagree with that. I think we did achieve that in Victoria. But I\ndo accept that in Europe there might be more behavioural fatigue because there\nhave been rolling lockdowns over a 13-month period, and it becomes much, much\nharder to say we just need to do another four months of very strict lockdown or\nthree months. \nZEIT: The second counter argument: No Covid requires an authoritarian approach\nwhich doesn’t work in a democracy.\nSutton: New Zealand has done it, Australia has done it, there are other places\nthat have done it that are clearly democratic countries. The idea that we would\neven restrict people to their homes and limit their exercise, time to go\nshopping for just an hour a day was probably not able to be imagined, but then\nthese are things that we hadn’t imagined before Covid.  Clearly, people were willing to do them. So, I\nthink it is not true that a democracy doesn’t allow for that. It depends how\nyou value life and health against those freedoms.\nZEIT: The third argument says it’s impossible to keep the incidence rate\npermanently at zero or almost zero \nSutton: if you can get to a level that is sustainable through test, trace and\nisolate, then I think it might be achievable. Whether it works will depend on\nyour contact tracing workforce, your systems for capturing that information,\nyour testing capacity and capability, and peoples’ willingness to home quarantine,\nif they are close contacts.\nZEIT: Last argument: A No Covid strategy damages the economy\nSutton: I think this argument is completely wrong. Those countries that have\nmanaged to control transmission have done better economically. I have seen research\nthat most of the economic activity is not constrained by lockdowns, but by\npeoples’ own changed behaviour because of very high levels of transmission and\nthe huge economic and societal costs as a result of people who can’t work, who\nare unwell, who are hospitalized and who are dying.\nZEIT: Almost a year ago on 23rd February, on Twitter you warned that a\npandemic was highly probable, if not unavoidable. In doing so, you were one of\nthe first government officials anywhere in the world to grasp the devastating\nconsequences of Corona. Since the outbreak of the pandemic has anyone from the\nGerman government or the EU tried to contact you and talk to you about your\napproach and what you’ve learned?\nSutton: I haven’t been contacted but I think, it would probably be normal practice\nfor national governments to speak to other national governments, so they would have\nspoken our prime minister’s office.\nZEIT: If you had the chance to talk to a German politician about the situation\nin Germany what would you ask?\nSutton: I guess, I wonder what their overarching objective is. What is the medium-\nand long-term strategy for the German population to protect them from Covid? ",
