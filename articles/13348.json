     "article": "The US democracy is strong enough to survive Donald Trump, says economic historian Harold James. He sees the pandemic as a decisive turning point for the whole country.\n\nHarold James is an economic historian. He is a Professor\nof History at Princeton University as well as the university's\nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. In 2004 he was awarded the Helmut Schmidt Prize for Economic History, \nand in 2005 the Ludwig Erhard Prize for writing about economics.\nLesen Sie dieses Interview auf Deutsch.\nZEIT ONLINE: Professor James, Donald Trump is lagging far behind in\nthe polls and all signs point to him losing the election. Many argue\nthat his mismanagement of the pandemic is the primary reason for his\nstruggles. Would you agree?\nHarold James:\nYes, and I think it’s not atypical. What is happening in the United States at the moment has happened before. Take President George W. Bush, for example: His handling of the Iraq war was terrible, but\nwhat really switched the view of the voters was his bad management of\nHurricane Katrina and the devastation of New Orleans.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Do you believe that without the pandemic, a Trump victory\nwould have been more likely?\nJames: There are only very few factors that have a significant impact on the\noutcome of elections. One is the state of the economy. Before the\npandemic broke out, it certainly wasn't as marvelous as Trump likes\nto portray, and he inherited the recovery from his predecessor Barack Obama. But in part due to the large stimulus provided by the Trump\nadministration, employment was growing, wages were rising, and growth\nwas stable. Without corona, all this might well have produced a\nvictory for Donald Trump.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Is the economy the only important factor for Trump voters?\nJames: When it comes to Donald Trump, there might be a little bit more at\nplay. He broke with the foreign policy consensus that the United States must be present around the world with its military. Barack Obama made\na similar promise; he at least pushed for a disengagement. But then,\nhe sent more troops into Afghanistan and became heavily involved in\nthe Middle East. Trump, on the other hand, delivered. His rhetoric\nhas been divisive, and the manner in which he alienated all kinds of\nU.S. allies has been appalling, but he didn't start any foreign wars,\nat least not any big wars.\nZEIT\nONLINE: His disrespect for the rule of law, the hollowing out of\ndemocratic institutions: Don't those things matter to the average\nvoter?\nJames: Many Americans don’t see Donald Trump as a threat to the rule of\nlaw. I think his activity wasn’t even very dramatic until recently.\nBut with his latest executive order, he is corroding the civil\nservice and putting his political appointees in positions where they\nwill be difficult to be dismissed in a new administration. Other\nadministrations in their dog days have done that in the past, but\nTrump is doing it on a much bigger scale. And that is really pretty\nterrifying. I do not deny that awful things have happened during the\nlast four years. Detained immigrants were treated terribly, just to\nname one example. But not too many Americans care about that.\nZEIT\nONLINE: You don't see Trump as an autocratic president who is\nskeptical of democracy?\nJames: Of course he is. But if you compare Donald Trump with the dictators\nand autocrats he admires – people like Kim Jong Un or Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Viktor Orbán– you'll realize that it's not much more\nthan rhetoric. Trump is only performing fascism. \n\nZEI\nONLINE: You see him as less of a threat to democracy than many argue?\nJames: Some people believe he is dismantling a system that was basically\ndesigned in the 18th century. And this system obviously has its\nlimits when faced with 21st-century realities and someone like Donald\nTrump in the White House. But I have to say, I am not convinced. The\nAmerican institutions are quite strong, democracy will survive Donald\nTrump. If he loses the election, I think we will see a rebound to\nsome form of pre-Trump normality, at least on the political front.\nZEIT\nONLINE: How quickly will that happen?\nJames: We are obviously in a situation with a lot of uncertainty. It depends\non what Donald Trump does if he loses on Nov. 3. If it's close and if\nthe election is followed by a lot of violence, and if Trump refuses\nto accept the result, then we would find ourselves in uncharted\nwaters.\nZEIT\nONLINE: And what happens if Trump does win the election?\nJames:\nSome people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 may have thought that\nhe would become more conventional and statesmanlike when in office,\nand that the inherent dignity of the office would envelop him. Those\nhopes were rapidly dashed, and it became clear that the new President\nhad embarked on a war against established institutions. In a similar\nway, there is no reason now in 2020 to think that he will behave like\nprevious Republican presidents in their second term – Reagan or\nGeorge W. Bush – who came in as iconoclasts and ended up as much\nmore conventionally and internationally oriented leaders.\nZEIT\nONLINE: That sounds rather harmless. Some fear that America would be\nvirtually destroyed by a second term of Trump.\nJames:\nThere will certainly be very hard four years. We are likely to see a\ncontinuation of the politics of rage, and a polarization that will\npush the United States into bitter constitutional conflict –\nespecially as it is extremely unlikely, maybe even virtually impossible that\nTrump’s party will take back the House of Representatives.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Donald Trump won in 2016 by a very narrow margin in a handful\nof swing states. Should the voting system be reformed?\nJames: I hope that some aspects will be overhauled. In the United States,\nthe president is not elected by a popular vote, but by way of a\ncomplicated system ending with the Electoral College ultimately\ndeciding who gets to move into the White House. It's conceivable to\nme that we might have to transition to a system where the president\nis elected the same way as in France. There, you know right at 8 p.m.\non election day who is the next president of the republic: The\ncandidate with the majority of votes.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Let's assume that Donald Trump leaves the White House\npeacefully: The new president will find himself faced with enormous\nchallenges, from battling the pandemic and economic recession to\nrising inequality and climate change. Can he be successful?\nJames: It will be very difficult. I would add the huge historical legacy of\nracial division to your list of problems. Barack Obama made his political debut with a\nspeech in which he said there aren't red states and blue states, but\nonly a single country called the United States of America. Biden makes the same argument, but you need more\nthan nice words. Maybe in retrospect, one could critiquethe Obama\nyears by saying that there was a lot of rhetoric, but not much was\nachieved.\nZEIT\nONLNE: Can you provide an example of what needs to change?\nJames:\nThe health and the education sectors are highly discriminatory. It\nwill be a real challenge tackling that. It requires a fundamental\nrethinking of the institutions. But at this point, I am slightly\noptimistic. New technologies and also the pandemic are forcing us to\nrethink things and maybe abandon old dogmas. You can see the huge\ntransformative impact of the pandemic in Europe already: The European\nUnion spent 10 years discussing whether there should be common fiscal\npolicy and common debt, but nothing happened. Once the coronavirus\npandemic arrived, though, the EU made a big step forward.\nZEIT\nONINE: Are you in favor of a European-style, statutory\nhealth-insurance scheme in the U.S.?\nJames:\nYes. The old American health-care system was based on the assumption\nthat people stay in the same job for most of their lives: Big\ncorporations like AT&T, IBM and Ford provided health care for\ntheir employees. But we are now in a completely different, more\nflexible world, so we need to come up with a different way to\norganize health care.\nZEIT\nONLINE: You have compared the current situation in the United States\nwith the final years of the Soviet Union. Where are the parallels?\nJames: Both systems were produced by a revolution: one in 1776 and the other\nin 1917. And later on, both systems had significant difficulties in\ndealing with technical and economic change and they both gradually\nlost their dominating positions in the world. For the Soviet Union,\nthe Chernobyl disaster may have been the most important turning\npoint, while for the U.S., it could be the pandemic. The Soviet Union\ndidn’t survive, but my hope is that the American system will prove\nmore resilient and can rebuild itself. Donald Trump didn’t provide\nany kind of solutions here. \nZEIT\nONLINE: How far-reaching will this rebuilding be?\nJames: It will be game changing. You can already see that the shift in\ntechnology has accelerated during the pandemic. Tomorrow, I'm doing a\nseminar in Cambridge, and on Friday, I'm doing a seminar in Basel. I\ncan do all that without having to travel. \n\nZEIT\nONLINE: What does that mean for the next government?\nJames:\nThe administration should not simply prop up old, existing companies\nthat could be both costly and unproductive. The cruise industry, for\ninstance, doesn't have much of a future. Does it really make sense to\npay cruise operators to continue employing people? Or would it be\nbetter to create incentives for the employees to do something\ndifferent? \n\nZEIT\nONLINE: Wouldn't such a process create rising unemployment and\ninequality?\nJames: You can indeed see inequality taking off during the pandemic. Many\npeople have lost their jobs and the very rich are apparently doing\nquite well in this crisis. That poses a threat to American society.\nThe task for the next government will be to generate new\nopportunities once we have overcome the current crisis. But that\ndoesn't mean locking them into dead-end jobs. That would simply be a\nwaste of all kinds of resources.\nZEIT\nONLINE: In other words, America needs a Green New Deal?\nJames: The USA needs to change – dramatically. And the transformation is going\nto take a long time and will be very costly. That brings us back to\nthe Soviet analogy: It was a leap in the dark at the end of the\nSoviet system. The U.S. today is in quite a similar situation. In the\nlast presidential debate, Joe Biden was asked about the future of the\noil industry under his presidency, and he answered honestly: In the\nlong term, there isn’t really a future for fossil fuels. But by\nsaying that, you alienate and frighten people in some of the key\nstates, like Pennsylvania, for example. \n\nZEIT\nONLINE: They fear that their jobs will disappear.\nJames: Exactly, but that will happen no matter what. There are other things\nthese people can do. They could build the transmission cables\nnecessary for the green energy instead of building oil pipelines, for\nexample. Of course, we can't promise all people that they will get a\njob in green technologies, but what we can predict is that the energy\nsaving technologies will produce a considerable amount of investment\nand generate a substantial amount of employment.\nZEIT\nONLINE: Is Joe Biden the right person for the job?\nJames: Barack Obama was one of the most brilliant speakers in recent\nAmerican history. His speeches were very powerful and emotional, and\nsome people felt bound together. Others, though, felt threatened. Joe Biden, by contrast, doesn’t look threatening to anybody. He is a\nfamiliar political figure, rooted in the old world of politics. So\nmaybe he is the right person for this huge transition. A great\nmajority of the American people want someone reassuring after all the\nangry rhetoric of Donald Trump.",
