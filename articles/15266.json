A few months later, they got married in their living room. \nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nHow are our European neighbors doing in the pandemic? What is life like\nthese days in France, Ireland, Bulgaria and elsewhere? In the series \"We\nNeighbors,\" Europeans will be talking about their everyday lives: the taxi\ndriver in Dublin, the mother in Paris working from home, the theater family in\nBulgaria. They are also all taking part in Europe Talks, a discussion event for\nwhich ZEIT ONLINE, together with media partners from 15 countries, is\nregistering participants. On Dec. 13, thousands of people from across Europe will\nmeet another European to discuss and debate the corona crisis.\n\"A\nfew years ago, I fell in love with a Scotsman. So deeply that I moved from\nBretten, a small town near Karlsruhe, to Glasgow. Unfortunately, our\nrelationship didn't last, but I stayed anyway. And I fell in love again: with\nGlasgow, with Scotland and with the people in this country.\nAnd\nthen Raj came along.\nWe\nmet each other at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, and at some point,\nwe realized we were neighbors. We would often invite each other over for brunch\nor dinner. And we became friends. Best friends.\nWhen\nthe lockdown arrived in spring, both of us started having similar feelings of\npanic. We were living on a street leading to a hospital and we could see and\nhear the ambulances every day. It seemed to us like the world was ending. Raj, who is\noriginally from Malaysia, had been in a serious\ncar accident a few years earlier and had lost his left hand. Since then, he has\nsuffered from chronic pain, nerve damage and a muscle disorder in his chest. The\nvirus is a greater threat for him than it is for others.\nI\nrealized that his concerns were growing, so I asked him if he wanted to move in\nwith me and my roommate for the lockdown. He could sleep in the living room. I\nfigured the COVID lockdown would be over in a couple of weeks. \nI\nalways thought Raj was great. But I was too timid to tell him everything\n– everything about me and my feelings. During the lockdown, though, it wasn't\npossible to hide it anymore. We were living together, after all. I think we\nwere in love even before the lockdown, but without it, we never would have had\nthe courage to tell each other.\nAt\nfirst, we started hugging more often and then cuddling on the couch – before we\nthen started sleeping in the same bed together. We gave each other a feeling of\npeace and relaxation in a phase of deep uncertainty. One morning, we were lying\nin bed together and he looked at me and said: \"I think I'm in love with\nyou.\" Wow, I thought, and then we kissed for the very first time. It\nsurprised neither us nor our friends. Somehow, it was clear that we were doing\nthe right thing.\nSoon, Scotland will have seen 100,000 people infected since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. As elsewhere in Europe, the second wave is hitting Scotland harder than the first.\n\nSince the three-week lockdown in October, Scotland has implemented a four-level system, with each region being evaluated according to the number of cases. In Level 1, restaurants remain open, hotels are allowed to accept guests, small events are permitted and fans can go to the stadiums. In Level 4, by contrast, public life is largely shut down, and even stores must close.\n\nTen of 32 regions in Scotland are currently classified as Level 4 and will remain so until Dec. 11. The Highlands, including Inverness, are currently classified as Level 1.\nThat\nwas in April during the first wave. People in Glasgow, including us, were only\nallowed to leave their homes once a day. Nobody was checking, but those were\nthe rules. Like Christian Drosten in Germany, Britain also has somebody to\nguide us through the pandemic. His name is Dr. John Campbell, a nurse and an\ninstructor who came out of retirement to make videos for YouTube. He's really\ngood at it and expertly helps people understand what is valid and what isn't. I\nreally like watching him.\nI\nalso like how our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon approaches the pandemic. She\nmanaged the first wave really well. Totally differently than Prime Minister Boris Johnson over in London. It is something I am often aware of, this contrast\nbetween England and Scotland. In Britain, of course, we're not just going\nthrough the COVID pandemic, but also Brexit, which most Scots don't want. I\nhave noticed the mood in the country shifting bit by bit. When I first arrived\nin Scotland, I still felt welcome and I was also able to go to university for\nfree. Now, though, Scotland wants to introduce tuition for students from the\nEuropean Union. I could never have afforded to pay tuition. I might never have\nmet Raj.\nAfter\nour first kiss, we talked a lot about how we imagined our futures. Raj already\nhad a job offer in Inverness, 270 kilometers away from Glasgow. One time, we\nwere lying on a meadow, the sun was shining, and I told him: \"I want to be\nwith you for a long time.\" I was a bit hesitant because I didn't want to\nput any pressure on him. But he just smiled and asked: \"You mean\nforever?\" From then on, it was clear to us that we wanted to spend our\nlives together. \nI\nwas never worried that things might be going too fast. One week later, we were\nsitting around together, him on the bed and me on the couch. I was writing in\nmy diary – I wanted to write down everything that had happened between us in\nthe last few days. I looked up, turned to him and asked, totally spontaneously:\n\"Do you want to get married?\" He didn't hesitate for a second.\n\"Yes.\"\nWe\nordered the rings on the internet. Shops in Glasgow weren't open, after all. When\nthey arrived, I proposed to Raj again, more formally this time. And he then\nproposed to me. We wanted to do it as fast as possible. In Scotland, you can\nget married anywhere you like, it doesn't matter. The only important thing is\nthat you are married by somebody who is allowed to do so, so we found a minister\nat the university who has a license to perform weddings. When we asked her, she\nlet out a scream of delight over the phone!\nRaj\norganized a suit and I put together an outfit with the help of the internet:\npants, blouse, shoes. I tried things on and returned stuff until everything was\nperfect – it took three to four weeks at least. On the day of the ceremony, we\nquickly bought a bridal bouquet at LIDL. \nThe\nceremony took place on Aug. 11 in our living room. The minister was there, we\nhad two witnesses and two close friends. That was it. We set the chairs up as\nfar apart from each other as we could to ensure proper distancing. And to make\neverything more hygienic, we packed a little bag for each guest. Inside was a\nglass, a small bottle of sparkling wine and a couple of sweets typical of the\ncountries we are from. I chose gummy bears and Kinder Chocolate while he chose rice\ncrackers and mochi, which are small, sweet balls made of rice flour. They’re\noriginally from Japan, but they are well known across southeast Asia. Nobody\nhad to share, but we were able to have drinks together – first in our living\nroom and later in the park around the corner. We made for quite the procession,\nwith Raj and I in the front in our wedding finery and the others behind us. People\nin the park realized that we had just married and started to clap. It was\nreally nice.\nThere are rules in Scotland about the words that have to be used in the ceremony. We followed them. The marriage document in Scotland has to be signed with a fountain pen and real ink, otherwise it's not valid. So, we did it and it was official that we got married in our living room in the middle of a global pandemic.\nIn\nhindsight, I sometimes think it would have been nice to have my parents there.\nWe considered doing a livestream. But in the moment, it felt right to do it for\nourselves, and only for ourselves.\nWe\nare now living together in Inverness. The city has just 50,000 residents and\ncurrently has hardly any corona cases at all, in contrast to Glasgow where the\nnumbers are still quite high. The pandemic isn't over yet, but there is no\ncomparison to the time when we were stuck in the apartment in Glasgow. \nRaj\naccepted the job and I am now finishing up my master's thesis. I never thought\nthat I would ever become a small-town person, but that's my current reality.\nAnd we're already planning to have children. This time, though, we're going to\nwait until corona is over.\"",
