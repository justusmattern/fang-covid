Protect ourselves from the virus or protect the economy? We are bringing 12,000 Europeans together to discuss the pandemic.\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nOn this Sunday afternoon, a man will sit down in front of his computer in Selnaj\u00f6ki in western Finland. He is over the age of 70 and retired. He enjoys reading books about politics and history in his free time, and occasionally goes swimming.\nAt the same time, a young woman will switch on her computer 2,800 kilometers away in the northern Italian city of Bologna. She is a 19-year-old university student. When asked what she is most worried about, she responds: The future.\nThe two have never met before. But on this Sunday, they will meet up on screen for a chat \u2013 about Europe and about what governments should be doing to confront the pandemic.\nIn Britain, a driver is preparing to meet up with a German biologist who has been holed up working from home. Two students from France and Austria, both of them 18, will be discussing what it means to be young in this pandemic.\nItalians will be speaking with Bulgarians, Poles with Spaniards and Germans with debate partners across the border in France.\nThey are all part of Europe Talks, an experiment that is taking place this year for the second time. The concept envisions thousands of Europeans meeting up for virtual, cross-border debates about the corona pandemic \u2013 at the end of a year in which the coronavirus has radically changed daily life in almost all European countries.\nThis year's Europe Talks event is presented by ZEIT ONLINE together with media partners from 15 European countries, including the Mirror in Britain, Republik in Switzerland, Delfi in Latvia and France24. Each posed the same seven, controversial \"yes\" or \"no\" questions to readers on their websites before then asking whether respondents wished to discuss the questions with another person from Europe.\nMore than 20,000 people registered for the event in this manner and 12,640 of them provided all of the necessary details so that they could be matched up with a debate partner. An algorithm then divided up the participants into the perfect discussion twosomes, with each pair including two Europeans who hold different opinions about as many of the questions as possible and who live in different countries in Europe. Because the discussions will be held exclusively via video calls in this pandemic year, the distance between participants plays no role this time around. (The postman from the Azores and the young Greek woman introduced above live the farthest apart of any debate pair.) We were able to find a discussion partner for almost all participants who confirmed their sign-ups.\nEuropeans from 34 countries have signed up for the event, more than the European Union has member states. Two debaters come from Iceland, two from North Macedonia and one from Monaco. The bulk of the registrations are from Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Britain and Italy. On average, participants are 44 years old, which is slightly older than the average age in the EU as a whole. Around 58 percent are men, though at 40 percent, the share of women participants is much higher than it was last year.\nParticipants this year were quite divided on a number of questions. On average, members of the debate pairings had different answers for 4.7 of the seven questions. Three of the questions proved most controversial: Should schools remain open throughout the pandemic? Is Russia a threat to Europe? And: Should all European cities be car-free? Almost all debating pairs will be arguing about those three issues.\nThere is more agreement when it comes to fighting the pandemic. Around 70 percent are in favor of prioritizing public health, even if the economy takes a hit, with 30 percent holding the opposite view. Support for a mask requirement in public places is just as high. In just 1,000 of the 6,000 discussion pairs did participants indicate different views on the issue. And there is almost universal agreement that richer countries should support poorer ones.\nLike last year, there are significant differences between men and women. Female participants are more open to a mask requirement than men (with support around seven percentage points higher). They also value protecting health over the economy to a greater degree. Women are also more supportive of a distribution mechanism that would force EU countries to accept refugees.\nAnswers differed significantly between some European countries \u2013 partly, no doubt, a function of the media outlet posing the questions. In Italy, Switzerland and Greece, participants showed a strong preference for requiring all EU member states to accept refugees, in contrast to Britain, Romania and Bulgaria. It is also striking that in Italy, where the coronavirus struck a particularly large number of people in the first wave, significantly more participants believe that protecting health takes precedence over business interests - more so than in Germany, for example.\nFrom a statistical perspective, the greatest differences between the answers given were between Bulgaria and Switzerland, while the smallest were between Belgium and Portugal.\nAt 3 p.m. Central European Time (CET) on this Sunday, the participants will meet up to talk about the right way out of the corona crisis \u2013 more than 6,000 potential meetings between Europeans who have never met before. Europeans who will come just a little bit closer as a result.\nTranslated by Charles Hawley and Daryl Lindsey", "twitter-history": "[{       \"id\": 1339195756536795136,       \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/britaintalks/status/1339195756536795136\",       \"date\": \"2020-12-16 13:08:44+00:00\",       \"text\": \"Really interesting read. #EuropeTalkshttps://t.co/2HcmrZzWU4\",       \"replies\": 0,       \"retweets\": 0,       \"likes\": 0,       \"quotes\": 0,       \"device\": \"<a href=https://mobile.twitter.com rel=nofollow>Twitter Web App</a>\",       \"poster\": {              \"id\": 1100785565530771461,              \"url\": \"http://mirror.co.uk/europetalks\",              \"profile_pic\": \"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1255788864846925825/XH0MC6Jc_normal.jpg\",              \"profile_banner\": \"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1100785565530771461/1555341585\",              \"username\": \"britaintalks\",              \"name\": \"Britain Talks\",              \"description\": \"@dailymirror, @zeitonline collaboration connecting people across Europe in the time of coronavirus.
