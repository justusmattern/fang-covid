The Tagesspiegel Checkpoint Coronavirus-update. What\u2019s the price of enjoying the world as we knew it? Now we have a calculation that is pretty precise: between \u20ac10 and \u20ac25,000. A price tag is now attached to the Corona restriction measures, and the catalogue of fines has been decided \u2013 after Berlin\u2019s Red-Red-Green coalition (SPD, Left, Greens) has been \u2026 well, arguing over it rather passionately (the choice of words varies, depending on who you ask, between \u201ca fierce argument\u201d and \u201cwe are in agreement\u201d).\nFor the next three weeks and weekends (including Easter), not only do the rules of \u201ccontact restriction\u201d still apply, but the consequences are now openly accessible. A brief summary: +++ Going out without a reason: \u20ac10 to \u20ac100 +++ Being too close (less than 1.5m): \u20ac50 to \u20ac500 +++ Participating in an event: \u20ac50 to \u20ac500 +++ Holding an event or gathering: \u20ac500 to \u20ac2,500 +++ Meeting in a group (not family): \u20ac25 to \u20ac250 +++ Accommodating tourists: \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac10,000 +++ Waiting lines without a safe distance: \u20ac100 to \u20ac2,500 +++ The opening of shops, restaurants, fitness studios... \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac10,000 (up to \u20ac25,000 if repeated) +++ ... \nIt\u2019s a long list and that\u2019s for a good reason. Because: what is a decree worth if it is followed up by nothing more than angry looks, words of warning or admonishing reminders? Who knows how long this standstill will last, must last? Won't the discipline automatically decrease with rising temperatures on one axis and duration of the restrictions on the other (extended until 19 April, by the way)\nAnd yet the coalition has made an effort to meet the understandable needs of its city\u2019s inhabitants. Which means: the parks will stay open \u2013 but it also means access can be restricted if it gets too crowded. And Interior Minister Andreas Geisel, of whom very little has been heard of so far, appears to be sitting on the same picnic blanket (symbolically!) as Mayor M\u00fcller (both SPD): As long as a distance of 1.5 meters (bench) or five meters (lawn) is kept and nobody barbecus (or burns anything else), hanging around in the sun is allowed \u2013 but only for a break from walks or exercise. The path should be the destination, not the park. \nWhat Geisel also made very clear: \u201cNot everything can be sorted out down to the last detail. And police work with a sense of proportion and are not primarily on the road to punish, but to clear up and avert danger. And if two people sit on a bench for a short time and the distance is kept, this is not the biggest problem.\" \nThe biggest problem is that if we begin to be careless now, it may end up having been all in vain, weather or no weather. Even with all the cautious optimism regarding the number of intensive care beds and flatter curve: no one sees any reason to relax the measures at this time. Therefore, the following still applies: staying at home doesn\u2019t cost a thing (Netflix and Spotify not included).\nFeeding the Police\nBack to the rules, back to the decision making in the Senate, which yesterday looked rather conciliatory: The Left would have liked to negotiate removing the obligation to give a reason for being out in the streets, but this regulation remains. In return, the obligation to show identification was removed again, which was especially important to the Greens. And Interior Minister Andreas Geisel was pleased that the regulations had been made concrete rather than softened, so as not to make the work of the police even more difficult. \nSpeaking of which: since mid-March the police have checked almost 2,000 locations \u2013more than 1,400 outdoors\u2013 and around 900 violations were reported. Even without the catalogue of fines, they were already able to see: the number of violations is decreasing daily.\nIf you have started to feel sorry for the police lately because they now only seem to be around to forbid you things that were just fine until the day before yesterday, you\u2019re free to bring them a cookie. In an internal briefing for police forces yesterday, the following was said: \"In the current COVID-19 situation, there are no objections to accepting tasty offerings (coffee, soft drinks, energy bars, food - of course only for take-away!)\u201d.\n \nCrisis Management Underway \nAfter some initial chaos, health senator Dilek Kalayci (SPD) is now proving her crisis-management nous. Not only has she succeeded in recruiting the second pensioner for her emergency hospital in Exhibition Hall 26 (official name: \"Corona Treatment Centre Jaff\u00e9stra\u00dfe\") after chief organiser Albrecht Broemme: Wulf Pankow, 67 years old, was most recently head of pneumology at the Vivantes Clinic in Neuk\u00f6lln (Medical Association President G\u00fcnther Jonitz calls him \"a highly deserving member\"). But cautious optimism is also spreading that the numbers could work out: \"The rate of infection is such that the medical facilities can keep up,\" M\u00fcller said in the House of Representatives. \"But we are far from out of the woods.\" Deutsche Bank found 100,000 surgical masks in the basement (procured long ago for SARS) and donated them to the state. And 600 medical practitioners have signed up to fight Corona: Retired, part-time, post-graduate, college, closed practices. What is still missing: nursing staff.\nBerendt\u2019s Numbers Chaos\nWhile Mayor M\u00fcller and Health Senator Kalayci are currently helping to calm the situation, Justice Senator Dirk Behrendt (Greens) has caused unnecessary confusion twice this week. In the Governing Mayor's new video podcast on Wednesday (we reported on it yesterday), he praised the new cooperation between the state laboratory under his command and pharmaceutical company Bayer to carry out 1,000 additional coronavirus tests daily. The test capacity is thus a quarter higher than last week. Getting the calculator out\u2026 can that be true? We checked back with the Health Administration, according to whom Berlin was already able to carry out 8,150 tests as of Wednesday. So we contacted Behrendt\u2019s speaker for clarification. His response: \u201cRight now there are moments when not every number is currently available, especially in free conversation.\u201d Uh huh\u2026 Better to say too much than too little, then? By the way: the additional 1,000 tests are evaluated by 140 Bayer employees. It wasn't possible to find out yesterday who initiated the collaboration, but it was possible to find out a lot else. They're still setting up, work will start on Monday. Whether we should then add to this 1,000 shall be sorted out in peace.\nAnother announcement that Behrendt made in the Tagesspiegel on Monday turned out to be somewhat strange: he wanted to get underage refugees out of the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos \u2013if necessary, without federal agreement. Now 72 hours later, he has to admit in the House of Representatives what should have been clear to him (being a lawyer): It won\u2019t work without federal agreement.\nMinimum Wage Embarrassment\nAlso embarrassing: what happened yesterday afternoon on Twitter after the House of Reps decided to raise the minimum wage to \u20ac12.50, the highest in Germany. A reason to celebrate, albeit virtually? Maybe not. The SPD faction around Raed Saleh issued a sole press release and tweeted: \"Done! The fair minimum wage! Now \u20ac12.50 (thumbs up emoji). Thanks to the Left and Greens for supporting our idea.\"\nThe reactions were prompt and violent: Labor Senator Elke Breitenbach: \"In the past, the Red-Red-Green coalition would have made a joint press release and celebrated such a success together....\" \"...Today, a collective neurosis seems to be alive and well (hand-over-face emoji)\" Sabine Bangert (MP, Greens): \"Perhaps it's because of the crisis\" Regina Kittler (MP, Left): \u201cShould we really now be asking the Swiss herb candy question in the sweat lodge?\u201dKatina Schubert (leader, the Left): \"If this was just your idea, you can now do it at the federal level. I don\u2019t think we need to do that, seriously.\"\u00dclker Radziwill (SPD): \u201cIn the end good teamwork & success for the Red-Red-Green coalition. As the first federal state, we have now increased the statewide minimum wage to \u20ac12,50, synchronized with the Public Procurement Act, and that\u2019s good. On the federal level, it\u2019s not failing because of @spdbt, rather because of the CDU\u201d. \nGeorg P. K\u00f6ssler (MP, Greens) tried to mediate: \"I have hope that we will do this again in the future. At the sight of the opposition there is no alternative to our coalition!\u201d\nThe matter is particularly explosive because the dispute over authorship between the Left and the SPD has been simmering for more than a year now - since Mayor M\u00fcller himself spoke out in the Tagesspiegel in November 2018 in favour of an increase to \u20ac12.63. My colleague Ulrich Zawatka-Gerlach, however, took a closer look back then and found out: The Left was right. As early as May, the Federal Ministry of Labour, in response to an inquiry by Susanne Ferschl (Left), a member of the Bundestag, had announced that an hourly wage of \u20ac12.63 euros was mathematically necessary \"in order to be able to receive a net pension above the basic old-age provision, given a working week of 38.5 hours over 45 years of employment subject to compulsory insurance\". At the end of 2017, this amounted to \u20ac814 for pensioners living outside nursing homes. M\u00fcller was sceptical at first - and then made the minimum wage project his own. And the Left\u2019s state leader Katina Schubert was already saying at the time: \"The Social Democrats stole that from us.\u201d\n \nCan medical students graduate this year?\nThe question of whether or not medical schools will be undertaking state exams in two weeks' time remains unresolved. Because the SPD state secretaries Steffen Krach (Science) and Martin Matz (Health) have not yet succeeded in answering this question, the Student Council Initiative of Medicine Berlin demanded in an open letter yesterday that students be spared a \"hammer exam\" shortly after their practical year. There is an optional solution (as the case in Saxony), that students could undertake exams, but for those \u201cindividual cases, however, in which the students would not be able to take the exam due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the beginning of the early practical year would still be possible and an extension of the study period would be excluded.\u201d Either way, what they want above all is this: clarity. \nPreparation for A-Levels in Progress\nMeanwhile in the schools, handles on windows and doors are already being disinfected and the tables are being moved to a safe distance so that the Latin Exam can begin with the A-levels on April 20. Since neighbouring states (Hamburg, Brandenburg, Schleswig-Holstein) are going through with early holidays, so Education Senator Sandra Scheeres to no choice but to announce this morning that Berlin\u2019s children will take regular A-levels exams this summer. In Brandenburg, Education Minister Britta Ernst has already sent around a whole catalogue of measures that will apply if school operations cannot be resumed on April 20. Here are some excerpts: \n\u2022 The school will inform the examinees electronically on a staggered arrival at the school on the day of the examination in order to avoid clusters of waiting students. \u2022 For the written examinations, all suitable premises of the school must be made available, including gymnasium, refectory and assembly hall if necessary.\u2022 In order to maintain the minimum distance of 1.5 metres, no more than four to five candidates and one teacher should be in the room, assuming a room size of 60 square metres. \u2022 If possible, teachers should wear gloves when viewing and handing over examination documents. \u2022 Students are required to leave the school building and premises immediately after handing in the examination papers. An - understandable - exchange of information about the exams between the students in groups is to be prevented.\nA-levels in the year 2020. Please move on (at an appropriate distance), there is nothing to see.\nWhat is happening at Tesla's Construction Ground?\nAnd what's Tesla up to? You know, that other Giga-topic that had us infected way back when? Good news and bad news (you decide): Although there is no date set for the ground-breaking ceremony for obvious reasons, the construction work on Tesla's Gigafactory at Gr\u00fcnheide (35km southeast of Berlin) appears to be going according to plan. The forest is gone, now it's time to clean up. My colleague Kevin P. Hoffmann drove by yesterday and noticed a lot of activity behind the flapping green plastic (bulldozers, reptiles and even cable harnesses!) More on this soon in the Tagesspiegel. In any case, Elon Musk will be staying in the USA for now.\n \nFinally Something to Celebrate\nMeanwhile, Hertha BSC celebrates a great success: five weeks unbeaten.\nIn Empty Trains\nApprehension about full U1 trains, running between Gleisdreieck and Uhlandstra\u00dfe again since yesterday, have not been confirmed yet. Checkpoint reader Wolfgang looked out of the window all day yesterday, directly at the bridge at Gleisdreick (\"We can see every train, so to speak\") and noticed the great emptiness: \u201cThere were merely two or three people in each car.\u201d\nNot much traffic at Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport\nOnce, we were notorious for counting the days since the BER airport\u2019s non-opening. Today we count passengers. Yesterday in Sch\u00f6nefeld airport, there were 23 \u2013the whole day.\nOpen to be closed again immediately\nThe tunnel at Gleimstra\u00dfe (near Mauerpark) celebrated a sad reopening yesterday: first, two years of nothing (due to major water damage), then it's open for traffic but no-one drives through, and now Pankow wants to close it again: the tunnel will become a bike lane. Let's see if a lone car deigns to slide on through before that happens.\nEnjoy your Kitchen Club\nBecause whingeing won\u2019t help (scientifically proven!), we now dance every evening in the kitchen, which has now turned into a virtual mini-Berlin: start-up, restaurant, gas station, cinema, snack bar, circus, concert hall, fire station \u2013and of course the club. School starts when we want to anyway \u2013and let's face it: not showering helps the water companies flatten their curves, right? Here\u2019s a playlist by our Tagesspiegel colleague Nadine Lange: DANCE! \nStefan Franzke, head of Berlin Partner, is dancing to music from \"La Boum\" tonight. He had to postpone his planned 50th birthday dance party, for reasons of The Time We Are Living In. A colleague wrote to him: \"Dance like no one is watching\". Like every day. \nBy the way: In Frankfurt am Main, the police have now taken over the evening entertainment and are blaring Elton John\u2019s \"Circle of Life\" through the streets. Any suggestions for Berlin?\nWe will be dancing the days away now for sure and will be back when you need us. \nFrom tomorrow the Checkpoint will move back to German-only. Stay healthy and flat (you know)!
