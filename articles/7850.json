Now we must choose. Do we give into fear, or work to get out of this crisis together?\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nThis text was written by the author Francesca Melandri for \"Europe Talks 2020\" and read during the event. Melandri became known to the German-speaking audience with her novel \"Eva sleeps\". Her text \"Lettera dal futoro\" about the course of the Corona pandemic, was first published in the French daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration in March 2020 and later translated into over 30 languages.\nWe are in the midst of a second wave of infections. People are sick and dying, economies had to shut down once again, there is enormous social and personal suffering. We are probably facing a very difficult winter.\nAs a consequence, people are swept away by many emotions. A sense of dread, fatigue, loss, uncertainty, fear, grief, sadness and a lack of perspective. A sense of being imprisoned, restricted. Of course every person experiences things in a different way, some are much worse off than others, and no, we are not all in the same boat, not at all. But there are feelings which, one could say, are rushing around in this pandemic present, like thick, poisonous winds. There is a certain, almost universal level of stress. \nThis is the kind of feeling of emergency, of extreme situations which, in the past, has given momentum to forces which are definitely not democratic. These dark emotions do not, historically, foster a rational, fact-based debate between people who hold different views. No. History shows us that if these feelings are left unheeded, it is very easy for manipulators to use them to their advantage. \nWe are already seeing how every issue now pulls the public in two seemingly irreconcilable positions, how more and more people think that those who hold different views are not just people with which one can argue, but enemies to be hated.  It\u2019s easy to see how this can be manipulated by authoritarians whose ideal society is the opposite of democratic. And authoritarians thrive on anxiety, stimulate it, and at the same do nothing, absolutely nothing, to actually address the legitimate reasons for a rational fear, like those about the impending climate change. \nThis is why I am convinced that acknowledging and giving a name to the emotions that are sweeping through society in this difficult year is not a sentimental act, it\u2019s actually a very political act. To bring them up, so to speak, to the sunlight, not let them lie there in darkness, loneliness, and shame, is the only way to prevent them being snatched by those manipulators. As historian Robert Paxton observed, \"Fascism is propelled by emotions, not thoughts\".  \nThis is why I think it\u2019s fundamental to remember a basic fact of human nature: underneath every resentment and hate lies fear, and underneath every fear there is pain. The pain of loss, poverty, loneliness, uncertainty, of unbearable stress. The pain of feeling overwhelmed by the intuition that this pandemic is just a taste of what global warming will bring. Which throws us in a state of bewildered helplessness. And underneath it all, that most human of emotions: the fear of death, both when it\u2019s spoken out directly or, more often, when it\u2019s expressed by its shadow side - the denial of death.\nAt the end of the day we are mortals, more and before anything else. And this is something that we cannot change. But we do have a choice on how we can use the awareness of our own fragility. We can use it as the gateway to the awareness of  the fragility of others, and therefore as fuel for more solidarity, for the fight towards more equality and justice for everyone.\nOr we can let authoritarians turn it into resentment, selfishness and hate. And this goes both at the individual and the collective level. If I am worried about not being able to pay next month\u2019s rent I can either resent that some people are still able to pay theirs, and hate them; or I can fight as a citizen for the social solidarity of all. In the same way, European countries facing impending economic recession or a health crisis, can choose to withdraw into selfish nationalisms, one against the other, or tackle these and further global challenges with a larger vision of the collective good, interest, and global relevance of a united Europe.\nCovid-19 has been a strong reminder of our shared mortality. It has brought home a very simple awareness, which 80 years of peace and middle-class well-being allowed us to push at the borders of our civilization\u2019s awareness: we are very fragile. Both as individuals and as societies.\nHow shall we use this renewed awareness of our fragility? This is our choice. This is the choice we are now facing: as living biological creatures, as social human beings, as Europeans, and as inhabitants of this beautiful, fragile planet.", "twitter-history": "[{       \"id\": 1338880012322295815,       \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/BettinaPalazzo/status/1338880012322295815\",       \"date\": \"2020-12-15 16:14:04+00:00\",       \"text\": \"My fav Italian writer Francesca Melandri is again having a very special and spot-on perspective on our post-pandemic world.
