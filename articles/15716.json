What can we learn from history?\nLesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch\nHistory may not\nrepeat itself. But it is possible to see its reflection in what we are\nexperiencing today. Has there ever before been a pandemic like the current one?\nOr is it completely unprecedented? It is helpful to take a look back in time to\nsee what lessons history might have for us.\nMark Honigsbaum is\na person who has turned to the past. In his book, The Pandemic\nCentury, he examines significant disease outbreaks from the 20th and\nearly 21st centuries. \"No two pandemics are exactly alike,\"\nHonigsbaum said in a recent telephone conversation, \"but there are lots of\nparallels between COVID-19 and the Spanish flu in 1918.\" \nIt is a comment\nthat isn't exactly hopeful. The Spanish flu, after all, was one of the largest\ncatastrophes of the last century. As World War I came to an end, around a third\nof the global population became infected with the virus that caused the flu,\nand many of them suffered from severe pneumonia. Their skin turned blue, blood\noozed out of their noses and they died gasping for breath – in Mumbai, in New York, in Stuttgart and all around the world. Rough estimates hold that around\n50 million people lost their lives to the Spanish flu, a number equivalent to\nbetween 2.5 and 5 percent of the global population at the time.\nIn contrast to\nthe acute respiratory disease COVID-19, which got its start in the Chinese city\nof Wuhan – in connection, it is believed, to a market that traded in wild\nanimals of a kind that could have transmitted the virus to humans – we don't\nknow precisely where the Spanish flu originated. Historians, virologists and\nbiologists have found indications that a precursor to the deadly flu pathogen was\nalready circulating in the years prior to the deadly 1918 pandemic. One trail\nleads back to a British military base in the northern French town of Étaples. \"The\nbase was crowded with soldiers,\" wrote virologists in a 2014 study (Isirv:\nWever & Van Bergen, 2014). It \"was situated near sea marshes with\nabundant migratory birds, had many farms nearby with pigs, ducks and geese\nreserved as food for soldiers (…). These conditions might have contributed to\nan outbreak of acute respiratory infection.\"\nGenetic analyses\nof the few tissue samples that we have from people who came down with the Spanish\nflu do, indeed, show that the virus's genotype contains gene segments that\nlikely originated in birds (Proceedings of the American Philosophical\nSociety: Taubenberger, 2006). Inordinately close proximity between humans\nand animals is often the jumping-off point for pandemics and many diseases that\npose a threat to humans – an estimated 60 percent (DFID: Grace et al.,\n2021) – are such \"zoonoses.\" The term refers to illnesses whose\npathogens, often viruses, suddenly jump from an animal to a human. That was the\ncase with the Spanish flu, with bushmeat that triggered Ebola outbreaks and\nwith COVID-19. We don't yet know for sure what creature was the source for the\ncurrent virus, but it is likely that the vector animal initially received the\nvirus from a bat. That theory is the result of genetic analysis performed on\nthe pathogen (Nature Medicine: Andersen et al., 2020).\nThe world is much\nmore closely linked today than it was in 1918. Prior to the outbreak, hundreds\nof flights a week took off from Wuhan to destinations around the world; and with\nits New Silk Road initiative, China has established tight ties with myriad places\nall over the world. But 1918 was also a year in which far-flung corners of the\nworld came closer together, primarily because of the war. In British military\ncamps in northern France, soldiers from India's Punjab, Sierra Leone and\nNigeria shared close quarters with the British and French, not to mention\nlaborers from China and Vietnam. Many of them carried the virus back home, thus\ndispersing it across the globe. Indeed, the spread was similar to the way\nSARS-CoV-2 advanced along trade and tourism routes in recent weeks.\nThe virus that\ntriggered the Spanish flu pandemic must have mutated in the months and years\nprior to March 1918 from a harmless flu pathogen to a deadly virus. Soldiers\nwere packed so closely together in the trenches and they died so quickly that\nthe flu virus had to adapt, says biologist Paul Ewald (Public Health Reports:\nByerly, 2010). From an evolutionary perspective, it is advantageous for viruses\nto refrain from killing their hosts since they need living humans and animals\nto multiply and spread. But in 1918, because soldiers were dying so quickly of\nother causes – such as gunfire, typhoid fever, severe diarrhea and complications\nfrom trench foot – a form of virus developed that was able to multiply\nextremely quickly. But the more rapidly it multiplied, the more deadly it\nbecame. And it was this fatal variation that spread at the end of the war.\nIn a 2019 article\nfor the medical journal The Lancet, pandemic historian Honigsbaum quotes\na passage from the play The Doctor's Dilemma by George Bernhard\nShaw. \"The characteristic microbe of a disease might be a symptom instead\nof a cause,\" the passage reads (The Lancet: Honigsbaum, 2019). In\nother words, the Spanish flu could be a symptom of global military conflict – in\npart because it affected many young soldiers who were packed together under\npoor conditions in drafty military camps, but also because the heavily censored\nwartime press hardly wrote about the outbreak at all. The global public, in\nother words, was long kept in the dark about the initial infections.\nBy contrast,\nHonigsbaum sees SARS-CoV-2 as a symptom of humans having pushed too far into\nthe habitats of wild animals and of the close international links that define\ntoday's world. But he also believes that the current pandemic shows the degree\nto which we have \"neglected basic research.\" The year 2002 also saw\nthe outbreak of a coronavirus: the pathogen that caused severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome, or SARS. It was a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, which is\nnow ricocheting around the world and causing COVID-19. Even though that was\nmany years ago, we still have no vaccine for SARS. One of the reasons for that\nfailure was money. A team led by Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of\nTropical Medicine in Houston, presented a vaccine candidate four years ago (Human\nVaccines & Immunotherapeutics: Chen et al., 2014). But when it came\ntime for a clinical study to determine its safety and effectiveness, defined by\nits ability to trigger the production of antibodies, nobody could be found who\nwas willing to finance it.\nThat, from\ntoday's perspective, was a bad mistake. Not just because SARS could reappear at\nany moment, but also because the SARS virus and the novel coronavirus are\ngenetically quite similar. It is very possible that a SARS vaccine may also\nhave provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 (see also: Nature: Zhou\net al., 2020).\nThere are, of\ncourse, vast differences between the Spanish flu – essentially a severe form of\nthe sickness that infects millions every year – and the novel coronavirus. Not\nonly is it a completely different kind of virus, but virologists also believe\nthat – in contrast to flu viruses – higher temperatures and lower humidity\nlevels won't have much of an effect on SARS-CoV-2 (for example Medrxiv:\nOliveiros et al., 2020). That means that we should not pin our hopes on the\npandemic vanishing this spring. On top of that is the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is\napparently much more contagious than the flu (Medrxiv: Read et al.,\n2020), even if some researchers point out that the Spanish flu, for its part,\nwas much more contagious than other waves of flu (Journal of Infectious\nDiseases: Andreasen et al., 2008). But perhaps the most important\ndifference is that in 1918, it was primarily people between the ages of 20 and\n40 who died from the disease. COVID-19, by contrast, poses particular dangers\nto seniors and people with pre-existing conditions – which doesn't, of course,\nmean that younger people cannot also die from the disease.\nGraphs showing\nthe rise in life expectancy throughout the 20th century all have a sharp downward\nspike between 1917 and 1919. Even if a large share of the world were to fall\nill with COVID-19 in the coming months and 1 percent of all infected people\nwere to die, we still wouldn't see such a dramatic spike. This is because the\neffect on average life expectancy isn't as great when the elderly die, since\nthey are already close to the expected extent of their lives. Furthermore, a\ncomparison of the (fragmentary) data on Spanish flu's mortality rate with the\n(extremely premature) data on SARS-CoV-2 reveals that the latter illness may be\nonly half as deadly (Emerging Infectious Diseases: Taubenberger &\nMorens, 2006 and Nature Medicine: Wu et al., 2020).\nAnd there is another\nthing that is completely different this time around: Whereas newspapers were\ncensored in 1918, and were anyway primarily focused on the war, the novel\ncoronavirus is receiving exhaustive coverage this time around. Since January,\nthe world has been closely following the pathogen's every move and precisely\nmonitoring efforts being made to stop its spread: Wuhan transformed into a\nghost town; doctors collapsing from exhaustion; all corners of the world\naffected; borders closing; public life vanishing from the streets. People are\nsitting at home staring into their smartphones and televisions. It's a bit like\nreality TV, just that we are all on the verge of being yanked into the action.\nPeak panic is\neverywhere – in the media, on the stock markets and in the parliaments. Swine\nflu, that particularly contagious flu epidemic that began in 2009, also hit the\nheadlines, as did the large Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015, but it was nothing\nlike the current coverage. It seems likely that COVID-19's media dominance trumps\nthat of every pandemic that came before it. People and politicians around the\nworld are only talking about one thing: corona. It is a phenomenon that Thomas\nZimmer, a historian at the University of Freiburg and an expert in\ninternational health policy, is keeping an eye on. He had actually been\nplanning on moving to the United States in a few weeks to take up a\nprofessorship at Georgetown University, but flying to the U.S. is no longer\npossible. Regarding the closure of schools, bars, shops and international\nborders, Zimmer says: \"In the history of the Federal Republic of Germany,\nthere has never been such a massive political reaction to a health\nproblem.\"\nHonigsbaum also\nsays: \"We are  entering uncharterted\nterritory.\" He compares the COVID-19 pandemic to World War II – not in\nterms of the destruction the violence left behind but in terms of the social\nand economic consequences. We won't know whether he is correct for several\nmonths, or perhaps even several years.\nWhat, though, can\nwe actually learn from past epidemics?\nThe first thing\nis that once a pandemic has passed, the world must do all it can to prepare for\nthe next one. There were sufficient warnings in the recent past of an impending\npandemic, including Ebola, Nipah, SARS, MERS and bird flu – yet not enough was\ndone. For years, scientists have been warning of a possible outbreak of the\nkind we are now seeing. And for just as long, the World Health Organization\n(WHO) has been telling its member states to take more decisive steps to\nprepare. Just last September, a report compiled by the Global Preparedness Monitoring\nBoard noted: \"The world is not prepared for a fast-moving, virulent\nrespiratory pathogen pandemic.\" Progress has been made, the report noted,\n\"but current efforts remain grossly insufficient.\" It argued that\nthere is a lack of monitoring systems, a shortage of research and development\ncapacity and an absence of a strong, public health service that can track\nchains of infections.\nWhen it comes to\npreparation, the focus at the moment, of course, is not primarily on the next\npandemic but on the next wave of COVID-19 infections. Pandemics proceed in\nwaves. The Spanish flu, for example, had three severe waves: the first in\nspring 1918, a particularly severe one in fall and winter of 1918, and a final\nwave in 1919 (New England Journal of Medicine: Miller et al., 2009). The\nnovel coronavirus pandemic could develop similarly. Viruses that travel around\nthe world, after all, aren't unlike a pinball: They jump from one side of the\nworld to the next, only to then return after a short period of time to trigger\nthe next outbreak at the place originally infected.\nThe\nPsychology of the Pandemic\nAnd past\noutbreaks have another thing to teach us as well: We have to act quickly. Very\nquickly. Mike Ryan, the head of WHO's Health Emergencies Program who helped contain\nseveral Ebola outbreaks, says: \"Be fast. Have no regrets.\" He also\nargues that \"speed trumps perfection. (…) The greatest error is to be\nparalyzed by the fear of failure.\" Ryan's message casts a different light\non what is currently going on in Germany and Europe. Nobody knows, of course,\nwhat effect school closures will have. But one lesson of pandemics is that we\ncan't wait. We have to take action. It is a message supported by the data:\nCities and municipalities in the U.S. that quickly shut schools and churches,\nand which banned public events, experienced less severe outbreaks of the\nSpanish flu (PNAS: Hatchett et al., 2007).\nScience has surely\nalready made significant progress. Researchers around the world are working\ntogether and producing important findings in record time – likely faster than\never before. It only took a few weeks for the pathogen to be identified and for\na test to be developed. Data about patients has been gathered under the most\ndifficult of conditions and clinical studies of possible therapies are underway.\nThe first results are expected shortly – and who knows, it could even be that a\ndrug developed for a different deadly virus could also help against SARS-CoV-2.\nOne candidate is remdesivir, which was developed to fight Ebola. Another is\nfavipiravir (Proceedings of the Japan Academy: Furuta et al., 2017),\nwhich was originally intended to treat the flu.\nScience has also\ncome closer to solving another riddle: Namely the question as to why it was\nmostly young people who succumbed to Spanish flu. It could have to do with the\nfact that people born around 1890 – a cohort for whom the 1918 influenza virus\nproved particularly deadly – had their first experience with the flu with a virus\nfrom the H3N8 group (Plos Pathogens: Gagnon et al., 2015). Decades\nlater, when their immune systems found themselves confronted with the H1N1\nvirus that caused the Spanish flu, they were unable to deal with it. Our immune\nsystems are, to a certain extent, shaped by the first flu virus they come into\ncontact with, which has an effect on how they react to other influenza\npathogens. Whether the same is true for coronaviruses remains a matter of\nspeculation. But Justin Lessler, who conducts research into the phenomenon,\nknown as \"imprinting,\" told the New Yorker that he believes it\nis. And that could help us understand why some people react more severely to\nthe virus than others.\nWe also know a\nlot more today about what goes on in people's minds, and how they change their\nbehaviors when a dangerous pathogen is racing around the world and directly\naffecting their daily lives. Steven Taylor is a clinical psychologist at the\nUniversity of British Columbia and the author of The Psychology of\nPandemics, perhaps the most comprehensive book on the subject. \"The burgeoning\nof xenophobia and panic buying, or the demand for quack remedies – we've seen\nall of that in previous pandemics,\" he says, adding that such knowledge\nhelps to react to such phenomena this time around. Governments can launch\ninformation campaigns, for example, or supermarkets can adapt supply chains to\naccount for panic buying.\nIn previous\nepidemics, such as during the swine flu (H1N1) scare in 2009, it became\napparent, says Taylor, that a lot of people head to the hospital out of fear.\nThat is something that must be prevented this time around, he says, because it overwhelms\nthe health-care system.\nBut perhaps the\nmost important lesson from the history of pandemics is a different one. Taylor says\nthat Hollywood films about pandemics have it wrong. There isn't a complete\nsocietal collapse, we don't become overwhelmed by chaos and revert to our base\ninstincts. Rather, he says, it has repeatedly been observed that people help\neach other and are nice to each other. During pandemics, he says, it can be\nseen over and over again just how much solidarity people exhibit.\nTranslated by\nCharles Hawley",
