From Monday to Friday at around 11am, an English translation of Checkpoint, Tagesspiegel's daily Berlin newsletter, will be provided on the Tagesspiegel website. We will update you on all relevant Coronavirus and Berlin news for free. Please recommend the English Checkpoint to your friends, colleagues, fellow students, and all non-native speakers who live in the city (learn more about the German edition here). Translation: Kathleen W\u00e4chter, Lily Coates\nOnly on Sunday, Berlin Mayor Michael M\u00fcller said: \u201cA social life will have to be possible\u201d. Two days after this sentence hovers over the city, Berlin is trying to come to terms with making an everyday life between protection masks, contact ban and defrosted meals. Can we do it?\nSome find it all too much, others too little \u2013 is the right measure somewhere in the middle? It\u2019s confusing that the different states give it different names and the rules vary in detail. For some areas it\u2019s a contact ban, for others a lockdown. \nIn Bavaria, the governing CSU ordered a state-wide curfew. Are we spared in Berlin because we\u2019re governed by the Red-Red-Green Coalition (SPD-Left-Greens), who are allowing outings with strict limits? What we all have in common is that we\u2019re left trying to make sense of what \u201ethe right measures\u201d actually mean.\nA New Social Everyday\nYesterday, a mother who sat down with her kids on a lawn was asked by the police to not do so: \u201eWhen people see others sit on a lawn they naturally follow and join in.\u201d The herd behaviour applies unfortunately not only to immunity but also holds true for other situations, like red lights and closed playgrounds.\nThe Police appear to be making every effort to enforce Berlin\u2019s new contact restrictions in a friendly way, even if it remains unclear whether one is allowed to sit on that park bench or not. So far, the current rule states: \u201eSports and movement out in the fresh air, alone or with members of the own household or with one other person is permitted. Gathering in groups is prohibited.\u201d \nBut there\u2019s no mention about lingering or taking a break. So does that mean no? The Senate\u2019s answer: \u201eNothing speaks against a short break as long as the visit to the park is for sports or exercise (including walks) \u2013 and needs to be in compliance with the regulations on the minimum distances.\u201d That means: You can take a (short) break, however keep a distance of 1.5 metres from the other person (whether that person lives with you or not).\n42yo Dies of Corona in Berlin\nGiven all that, should it perhaps have been a little more? As long as the wind blows ice cold, the days aren\u2019t too inviting for long stays outside. So, not a problem for now. But this might soon change. By this weekend, a sunny 15\u00b0C is expected and after a week of hibernation, this could cause a real challenge to herd discipline. Especially as many are in a forced break at home and have plenty of time to ruminate over the question of when this curve will finally be flat enough for us to be able to sit outside on a picnic blanket.\nIn the midst of all this, remember: this is not just about some annoying ordinance. Yesterday in Berlin a third person died of the coronavirus. He was 42 years old.\nQuarantine or Not?\nThe Mayor expects the current restrictions to carry on until after Easter. On last night\u2019s rbb talk show \u201eWe\u2019ve Got to Talk,\u201d he openly disagreed with fellow party member, Health Senator Kalayci, who on Monday had called all people over 70 to remain in quarantine. \u201eYou know my position on the lock-down, so you can imagine where I stand on a quarantine\u201d, M\u00fcller said. This was not in line with the Senate. Let\u2019s see where he stands in a month.\nThe Unresolvable School Question\nAs an example of how quickly situations can change at the moment, look at the A-Levels (Abitur). At first, Senator for Schools Sandra Scheeres didn\u2019t want to postpone the exams at all, but now they are planned to take place after the Easter holidays. And although Berlin\u2019s Government is aware Corona won\u2019t be gone by then, Senator Scheeres is hesitant to call off the exams altogether.\nWhile she was still trying to figure out a solution in line with her colleagues from the states Hamburg, Brandenburg and Schleswig-Holstein, Education Minister Karin Prien in Schleswig-Holstein had already cancelled the exams in her state. Still to be solved\u2026\n\u201ePeople Need Security and Clear Communication\u201d\nWhat can be done? Well-respected German sociologist Jutta Allmendinger said in her guest visit at the Senate Meeting yesterday: \u201ePeople need security and planability, clear communication.\u201d What else can be done except to cancel (hello International Olympic Committee!)? \nFor most students it would be an advantage if the average grades of the school year were to come into play, as they\u2019re often more favourable than exam grades. You know what? Give this small advantage to the kids. Who\u2019d blame them for it?\nMasks Become Hot Topic\nIt is impressive how quickly we adapt to all of this \u2013 luckily. Or would you have predicted two weeks ago that you could start finding it normal \u2013 responsible even \u2013 to see people wearing masks in the supermarket? But the world is different today and we wait at the entrance just like we used to at the club door. We hope to be admitted in and that there is still some good stuff left for us. \nIt really is a little like the old Club rules. Keep a distance \u2013 and if it\u2019s full, it\u2019s full. The only difference being now, that before putting your shopping basket back on the stack, a friendly guide asks you to hand it to him for disinfection. What a service!\n6M Masks Missing\nIn an unusual turnaround, given the laws against masked protest (will May Day still happen?), we\u2019re now seeing police escorting mask deliveries. And this comes with a good reason: Just yesterday, Der Spiegel reported that 6 million masks ordered by the army have disappeared without a trace.\nHow many of these were intended for Berlin is unclear, but it explains a certain nervousness on the subject in recent days. Health Senator Kalayci appeared distinctly surprised on Monday when only 8,000 masks were delivered to medical practices \u2013 approximately one per each practice.\n#stayathome\nAs it happens, Ebay has restricted the sale of masks. So if you find masks somewhere, have them brought to the hospital. Masks are also becoming a topic everywhere online. The hashtag #stayathome (#bleibtzuhause) and #wearamask (#maskeauf) are trending and German celebrities like Charlotte Roche, Rezo & Lena Meyer-Landrut are diving in when it comes to facial coverings. An important note: Medical masks should remain in the medical field, where they are urgently needed, so make your own mask. DIY.\nMembers of Parliament Infected\nMajor M\u00fcller is still planning to give his government declaration on Thursday. Up until now, no changes have been announced, even with two Corona cases in Parliament. Two MPs have tested positive and are in quarantine. In a crisis meeting today, a decision will be made on whether Parliamentary sittings are still to take place.\nIf sittings do continue, the seating order will be reduced significantly. Yesterday, political parties were given a new seating plan. And additional rules have already been already put in place: no more signs on doors in order to avoid queues. \nQuestions are to be made from a seated position, papers will no longer be shared and the microphone is to be disinfected after every speech. The initial insecurity about using tech for conferences etc. has thankfully passed and quorums can take place via Chat. Parliament seems to be coping and adjusting, just like the rest of us.\nHelp Everywhere\nState Secretary Sawsan Chebli wrote in a forthcoming piece for Tagesspiegel: \u201eCorona has changed our country, but I am not talking about the standstill or the sudden silence out on the streets and in the parks\u2026 What I am talking about is that after all the hatred, the racism and division of recent times, the friendly faces of our society are showing up in view of the huge challenges with which we are faced. \nThere are notes in building entrances from people offering help to neighbours, there are calls online to join the #Neighborhoodchallenge, supermarkets are calling for help and rental companies are offering support and assistance to their renters. And on balconies people offer applause to those carrying the load of this, those who are working tirelessly keeping things going, treating and caring for the sick, saving lives and helping to assist those who cannot leave their homes.\u201d\nA Neuk\u00f6lln Registry Officer has extended his services and is offering to wed people in his kitchen. Neuk\u00f6lln\u2019s City Councilor asked: \u201eBut what would you serve with it?\u201d, Registry officer: \u201eIsn\u2019t a legally valid marriage enough? N\u00fcscht,\u201d (\u201enothing\u201d in Berlin slang), \u201ejust like in the office.\u201d\nThe traffic turnaround in general is a Corona side-effect. A data analysis by Tagesspiegel\u2019s Innovation Lab showed a stark reduction: last Thursday traffic congestion was 31 percent lower than in the previous year\u2019s average.\nWarm Heart, Clean Hands!\nThe Berlin Water Company has announced that they will not turn off the tap for anyone. \u201eWashing hands is vital these days - everyone should have access to water.\u201d\nIf you\u2019d like to share your experience of how your life has changed with the Coronavirus, we look forward hearing from you! Send in your story or a video message with the reference \u201cCorona-Geschichten\u201d.\nTo wrap things up today, we would like to share a message from the Swiss Association of Mental Health that comes just at the right time: \u201eDear fellow citizens, if you have begun to speak to your pets, plants or household devices, you\u2019re acting perfectly NORMAL. You do not have to contact us. Do however get in touch if your pets, plants or household devices begin to talk back to you. Best wishes, Your overworked Psychiatrists and Psychotherapists.\u201c\nOn that note, wish your cactus a good morning. Politeness is also important in the home office.
