### Training Splits

Our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.fever-1.9.pdf) presents results for two training splits, a random training split and a media-seperated split. The former follows the standard 5-fold validation framework, the latter seperates training and test split by publishers to test the generalization capabilities. 

To replicate the media-seperated split, use the following sources for testing and remove them from the training set:

- Sueddeutsche
- FreieWelt
- Compact-Online
- Kopp-Report
- AnonymousNews
